Rendering of multi-status responses is suboptimal in SOPE:
  PROPPATCH "subresponses" indicates either complete failure or success
  REPORT responses are handled by SOGo
Therefore it would be nice to refactor those things a little bit and maybe put
some code from SOGo up into SOPE.

ACL:
- the "default user" concept in the SOGo ACL paradigm should probably match
the "authenticated" role in SOGo/SOPE. Also, we should reconsider the handling
of the DAV:authenticated principal wrt the DAV ACL interface.
- we should add support for DAV privilege descriptions
