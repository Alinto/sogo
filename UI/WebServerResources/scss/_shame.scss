// This is the shame file (http://csswizardry.com/2013/04/shame-css/)
// RULES
// 1. If itâ€™s a hack, it goes in shame.css.
// 2. Document all hacks fully:
//    1. What part of the codebase does it relate to?
//    2. Why was this needed?
//    3. How does this fix it?
//    4. How might you fix it properly, given more time?
//    3. Do not blame the developer; if they explained why they had to do it
//       then their reasons are probably (hopefully) valid.
// 4. Try and clean shame.css up when you have some down time.
//    Even better, get a tech-debt story in which you can dedicate actual sprint time to it.
//

// 1. Component : autoScrollList
// 2. Suddently, the date span of the first list item of the messagae-list do not
//    justify to the extreme right of his container (flex-box)
//    After more than an hour spent analysing trying to find differences with other
//    list element. I still can't find any.
// 3. I decide to apply a minimal width to the left element until I found a culprit.
