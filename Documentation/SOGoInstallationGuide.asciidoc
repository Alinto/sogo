About this Guide
----------------

This guide will walk you through the installation and configuration of
the SOGo solution. It also covers the installation and configuration of
SOGo ActiveSync support - the solution used to synchronize mobile
devices with SOGo.

The instructions are based on version {release_version} of SOGo.

The latest version of this guide is available
at https://www.sogo.nu/support.html#/documentation.

Introduction
------------

SOGo is a free and modern scalable groupware server. It offers shared
calendars, address books, and emails through your favourite Web browser
and by using a native client such as Mozilla Thunderbird and Lightning.

SOGo is standard-compliant. It supports CalDAV, CardDAV, GroupDAV, iMIP
and iTIP and reuses existing IMAP, SMTP and database servers - making
the solution easy to deploy and interoperable with many applications.

SOGo features:

* Scalable architecture suitable for deployments from dozens to many
thousands of users
* Rich Web-based interface that shares the look and feel, the features
and the data of Mozilla Thunderbird and Lightning
* Improved integration with Mozilla Thunderbird and Lightning by using
the SOGo Connector and the SOGo Integrator
* Two-way synchronization support with any Microsoft ActiveSync-capable
device, or Outlook 2013/2016

SOGo is developed by a community of developers located mainly in North
America and Europe. More information can be found at https://sogo.nu/

Architecture and Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

image::images/architecture.png[System Architecture, 400, 964]

Standard protocols such as CalDAV, CardDAV, GroupDAV, HTTP, IMAP and
SMTP are used to communicate with the SOGo platform or its
sub-components. Mobile devices supporting the Microsoft ActiveSync
protocol are also supported.

To install and configure the Outlook CalDav Synchronizer, please refer
to the _Outlook Connector Configuration Guide_.

System Requirements
-------------------

Assumptions
~~~~~~~~~~~

SOGo reuses many components in an infrastructure. Thus, it requires the
following:

* Database server (MySQL, PostgreSQL or Oracle)
* LDAP server (OpenLDAP, Novell eDirectory, Microsoft Active Directory
and others)Â 
* SMTP server (Postfix, Sendmail and others)
* IMAP server (Courier, Cyrus IMAP Server, Dovecot and others)

If you plan to use ActiveSync, an IMAP server supporting the ACL,
UIDPLUS, QRESYNC, ANNOTATE (or X-GUID) IMAP extensions is required,
such as Cyrus IMAP version 2.4 or later, or Dovecot version
2.1 or later. If your current IMAP server does not support these
extensions, you can use Dovecot's proxying capabilities.

In this guide, we assume that all those components are running on the
same server (i.e., `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`) that SOGo will be
installed on.

Good understanding of those underlying components and GNU/Linux is
required to install SOGo. If you miss some of those required components,
please refer to the appropriate documentation and proceed with the
installation and configuration of these requirements before continuing
with this guide.

The following table provides recommendations for the required
components, together with version numbers:

|=============================================
|Database server	|PostgreSQL 7.4 or later
|LDAP server		|OpenLDAP 2.3.x or later
|SMTP server		|Postfix 2.x
|IMAP server		|Cyrus IMAP Server 2.4.x or later
|=============================================

More recent versions of the software mentioned above can also be used.

Operating System Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following operating systems are currently supported by SOGo:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Server 7, 8 and 9
* Community ENTerprise Operating System (CentOS) 7, 8 and 9
* Debian GNU/Linux 7.0 (Wheezy), 8.0 (Jessie), 9.0 (Stretch), 10 (Buster), 11 (Bullseye) and 12 (Bookworm)
* Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty), 16.04 (Xenial), 18.04 (Bionic), 20.04 (Focal) and 22.04 (Jammy)

Make sure the required components are started automatically at boot time
and that they are running before proceeding with the SOGo configuration.
Also make sure that you can install additional packages from your
standard distribution. For example, if you are using Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 7, you have to be subscribed to the Red Hat Network before
continuing with the SOGo software installation.

NOTE: This document covers the installation of SOGo under RHEL 7.

For installation instructions on Debian and Ubuntu, please refer
directly to the SOGo website at https://sogo.nu/faq/installation.html.

Note that once the SOGo packages are installed under Debian and Ubuntu,
this guide can be followed in order to fully configure SOGo.

Installation
------------

This section will guide you through the installation of SOGo together
with its dependencies. The steps described here apply to an RPM-based
installation for a Red Hat or CentOS 7 distribution. Most of these steps
should apply to all supported operating systems.

Software Downloads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[NOTE]
In order to access the production builds, you need a proper support contract
from https://sogo.nu/support/index_new.html#support-plans[Alinto]. Continue
with the configuration once you received your username and password.

SOGo can be installed using the `yum` utility. To do so, first create
the `/etc/yum.repos.d/sogo.repo` configuration file with the following
content:

----
[SOGo]
name=Alinto SOGo Repository
baseurl=https://<username>:<password>@packages.sogo.nu/release/5/rhel/7/$basearch
gpgcheck=1
----

[NOTE]
Any non-URL safe characters in username/password must be URL-encoded.  For
example, if your password is `so%go`, you must set the value in your
configuration file to `so%25go` - where `%` is encoded to `%25`.

Alinto signs its RPM packages with its GPG key. Integrity verification happens
all by itself on package installation, all you need to do is first import the
key into your rpm keychain:

----
rpm --import "http://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0xCB2D3A2AA0030E2C"
rpm --import "https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/74FFC6D72B925A34B5D356BDF8A27B36A6E2EAE9"
----

Some of the softwares on which SOGo depends are available from the repository
"Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux" (EPEL). To add EPEL to your packages
sources, install the following package:

On RHEL/CentOS 7
----
rpm -ivh https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
----

For RHEL/CentOS 8
----
yum install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm
----

For RHEL/CentOS 9
----
dnf install -y epel-release && dnf update -y
dnf install -y yum-utils && dnf config-manager --set-enabled crb
----

SOGo relies on the GNUstep and ytnef packages provided by Alinto and must not use the
packages from EPEL. Adjust the repository definition to exclude those packages:

----
sed -i '/enabled=1/a exclude=gnustep* ytnef*' /etc/yum.repos.d/epel.repo
----

For more information on EPEL, visit http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL/.

Software Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the yum configuration file has been created, you are now ready to
install SOGo and its dependencies. To do so, proceed with the following
command:

 yum install sogo

This will install SOGo and its dependencies such as GNUstep, the SOPE
packages and memcached. Once the base packages are installed, you need
to install the proper database connector suitable for your environment.
You need to install `sope49-gdl1-postgresql` for the PostgreSQL database
system, `sope49-gdl1-mysql` for MySQL or `sope49-gdl1-oracle` for Oracle.
The installation command will thus look like this:

 yum install sope49-gdl1-postgresql

Once completed, SOGo will be fully installed on your server. You are now
ready to configure it.

Configuration
-------------

In this section, you'll learn how to configure SOGo to use your existing
LDAP, SMTP and database servers. As previously mentioned, we assume that
those components run on the same server on which SOGo is being
installed. If this is not the case, please adjust the configuration
parameters to reflect those changes.

GNUstep Environment Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SOGo makes use of the GNUstep environment. GNUstep is a free software
implementation of the OpenStep specification which provides many
facilities for building all types of server and desktop applications.
Among those facilities, there is a configuration API similar to the
"Registry" paradigm in Microsoft Windows. In OpenSTEP, GNUstep and MacOS
X, these are called the "user defaults".

In SOGo, the user's applications settings are stored
in `/etc/sogo/sogo.conf`. You can use your favourite text editor to
modify the file.

The `sogo.conf` file is a serialized _property list_. This simple format
encapsulates four basic data types: arrays, dictionaries (or hashes),
strings and numbers. Numbers are represented as-is, except for booleans
which can take the unquoted values `YES` and `NO`. Strings are not
mandatorily quoted, but doing so will avoid you many problems. A
dictionary is a sequence of key and value pairs separated in their
middle with a `=` sign. It starts with a `{` and ends with a
corresponding `}`. Each value definition in a dictionary ends with a
semicolon. An array is a chain of values starting with `(` and ending
with `)`, where the values are separated with a `,`. Also, the file
generally follows a C-style indentation for clarity but this indentation
is not required, only recommended. Block comments are delimited by `/*`
and `*/` and can span multiple lines while line comments must start with
`//`.

The configuration must be contained in a root dictionary, thus be completely
wrapped within curly brackets `{ [configuration] }`. If SOGo refuses to
start due to syntax errors in its configuration file, `plparse` is helpful
for finding these, as it indicates the line containing the problem.

Preferences Hierarchy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SOGo supports domain names segregation, meaning that you can separate
multiple groups of users within one installation of SOGo. A user
associated to a domain is limited to access only the users data from the
same domain. Consequently, the configuration parameters of SOGo are
defined on three levels:

image::images/preferences-hierarchy.png[Preferences Hierarchy, 400, 400]

Each level inherits the preferences of the parent level. Therefore,
domain preferences define the defaults values of the user preferences,
and the system preferences define the default values of all domains
preferences. Both system and domains preferences are defined in
the `/etc/sogo/sogo.conf`, while the users preferences are configurable
by the user and stored in SOGo's database.

To identify the level in which each parameter can be defined, we use the
following abbreviations in the tables of this document:

[cols="^5,95"]
|====================================================================
|S |Parameter exclusive to the system and not configurable per domain
|D |Parameter exclusive to a domain and not configurable per user
|U |Parameter configurable by the user
|====================================================================

Remember that the hierarchy paradigm allow the default value of a
parameter to be defined at a parent level.

General Preferences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following table describes the general parameters that can be set:

[cols="^4,46,50a"]
|=======================================================================
|S |WOWorkersCount
|The amount of instances of SOGo that will be spawned
to handle multiple requests simultaneously. When started from the init
script, that amount is overridden by the `PREFORK` value
in `/etc/sysconfig/sogo` or `/etc/default/sogo`. A value of 3 is a
reasonable default for low usage. The maximum value depends on the CPU
and IO power provided by your machine: a value set too high will
actually decrease performances under high load.

Defaults to 1 when unset.

|S |WOListenQueueSize |
This parameter controls the backlog size of the
socket listen queue. For large-scale deployments, this value must be
adjusted in case all workers are busy and the parent processes receives
lots of incoming connections.

Defaults to 5 when unset.

|S |WOPort
|The TCP listening address and port used by the SOGo
daemon. The format is `ipaddress:port`. To bind to an IPv6 address, use
`[ipv6address]:port`, e.g. `[::1]:20000`.

Defaults to `127.0.0.1:20000` when unset.

|S |WOLogFile
|The file path where to log messages. Specify `-` to log to
the console.

Defaults to `/var/log/sogo/sogo.log`.

|S |WOPidFile
|The file path where the parent process id will be written.

Defaults to `/var/run/sogo/sogo.pid`.

|S |WOWatchDogRequestTimeout
|This parameter specifies the number of minutes after which a busy child
process will be killed by the parent process.

Defaults to 10 (minutes).

Do not set this too low as child processes replying to clients on a slow
internet connection could be killed prematurely.

|S |WOMaxUploadSize
|Parameter used to set the maximum allowed size for content being
sent to SOGo using a PUT or a POST call. This can also limit the file
attachment size being uploaded to SOGo when composing a mail. The
value is in kilobytes. By default, the value is 0, or disabled so no
limit will be set.

|S |SOGoMaximumMessageSizeLimit
|Parameter used to set the maximum allowed email message size when
composing a mail. The value is in kilobytes. By default, the value is 0,
or disabled so no limit will be set.

|S |SxVMemLimit
|Parameter used to set the maximum amount of memory (in
megabytes) that a child can use. Reaching that value will force children
processes to restart, in order to preserve system memory.

Defaults to `384`.

|S |SOGoMemcachedHost
|Parameter used to set the hostname and optionally the port of the
memcached server.

A path can also be used if the server must be reached via a Unix socket.

Defaults to `localhost`.

See `memcached_servers_parse(3)` for details on the syntax.

|S |SOGoCacheCleanupInterval
|Parameter used to set the expiration (in seconds) of each object in the
cache.

Defaults to `300`.

|S |SOGoAuthenticationType
|Parameter used to define the way by which users will be authenticated.
For C.A.S., specify `cas`. For SAML2, specify `saml2`. For anything
else, leave that value empty.

|S |SOGoTrustProxyAuthentication
|Parameter used to set whether HTTP username should be trusted.

Defaults to `NO` when unset.

|S |SOGoEncryptionKey
|Parameter used to define a key to encrypt the passwords of remote Web
calendars when _SOGoTrustProxyAuthentication_ is enabled.

|S |SOGoCASServiceURL
|When using C.A.S. authentication, this specifies the base url for
reaching the C.A.S. service. This will be used by SOGo to deduce the
proper login page as well as the other C.A.S. services that SOGo will
use.

|S |SOGoCASLogoutEnabled
|Boolean value indicating whether the "Logout" link is enabled when
using C.A.S. as authentication mechanism.

The "Logout" link will end up calling _SOGoCASServiceURL_/logout to
terminate the client's single sign-on C.A.S. session.

|S |SOGoAddressBookDAVAccessEnabled
|Parameter controlling WebDAV access to the Contacts collections.
This can be used to deny access to these resources from Lightning for
example.

Defaults to `YES` when unset.

|S |SOGoCalendarDAVAccessEnabled
|Parameter controlling WebDAV access to the Calendar collections.

This can be used to deny access to these resources from Lightning for
example.

Defaults to `YES` when unset.

|S |SOGoSAML2PrivateKeyLocation
|The location of the SSL private key file on the filesystem that is used
by SOGo to sign and encrypt communications with the SAML2 identity
provider. This file must be generated for each running SOGo service
(rather than host). Make sure this file is readable by the SOGo user.

|S |SOGoSAML2CertificateLocation
|The location of the SSL certificate file. This file must be generated
for each running SOGo service. Make sure this file is readable by the SOGo user.

|S |SOGoSAML2IdpMetadataLocation
|The location of the metadata file that describes the services available
on the SAML2 identify provider. The content of this file is usually generated
directly by your SAML 2.0 IdP solution. For example, using SimpleSAMLphp, you
can get the metadata directly from https://MYSERVER/simplesaml/saml2/idp/metadata.php
Make sure this file is readable by the SOGo user.

|S |SOGoSAML2IdpPublicKeyLocation
|The location of the SSL public key file on the filesystem that is used
by SOGo to sign and encrypt communications with the SAML2 identity
provider. This file should be part of the setup of your identity
provider. Make sure this file is readable by the SOGo user.

|S |SOGoSAML2IdpCertificateLocation
|The location of the SSL certificate file. This file should be part of
the setup of your identity provider. Make sure this file is readable by the SOGo user.

|S |SOGoSAML2LoginAttribute
|The attribute provided by the IdP to identify the user in SOGo.

|S |SOGoSAML2LogoutEnabled
|Boolean value indicated whether the "Logout" link is enabled when using
SAML2 as authentication mechanism. When using this feature, SOGo will invoke
the IdP to proceed with the logout procedure. When the user clicks on the logout
button, a redirection will be made to the IdP to trigger the logout.

|S |SOGoSAML2LogoutURL
|The URL to which redirect the user after the "Logout" link is clicked.
SOGoSAML2LogoutEnabled must be set to YES. If unset, the user will be
redirected to a blank page.

|D |SOGoTimeZone
|Mandatory parameter used to set a default time zone for users. The default
timezone is set to UTC. The Olson database is a standard database that
takes all the time zones around the world into account and represents
them along with their history. On GNU/Linux systems, time zone
definition files are available under `/usr/share/zoneinfo`. Listing the
available files will give you the name of the available time zones.
This could be `America/New_York`, `Europe/Berlin`, `Asia/Tokyo` or
`Africa/Lubumbashi`.

In our example, we set the time zone to `America/Montreal`.

|D |SOGoMailDomain
|Parameter used to set the default domain name used by SOGo. SOGo uses
this parameter to build the list of valid email addresses for users.

In our example, we set the default domain to `acme.com`.

|D |SOGoAppointmentSendEMailNotifications
|Parameter used to set whether SOGo sends or not email notifications to
meeting participants. Possible values are:

[options="compact"]
* `YES` - to send notifications
* `NO` - to not send notifications

|D |SOGoFoldersSendEMailNotifications
|Same as above, but the notifications are triggered on the creation of a
calendar or an address book.

|D |SOGoACLsSendEMailNotifications
|Same as above, but the notifications are sent to the involved users of
a calendar or address book's ACLs.

|D |SOGoCalendarDefaultRoles
|Parameter used to define the default roles when giving permissions to a
user to access a calendar. Defaults roles are ignored for public
accesses. Must be an array of up to five strings. Each string defining a
role for an event category must begin with one of those values:

* ObjectEraser

Example: `SOGoContactsDefaultRoles = ("ObjectEditor");`

Defaults to no role when unset.

|D |SOGoSuperUsernames
|Parameter used to set which usernames require administrative privileges
over all the users tables. For example, this could be used to post
events in the users calendar without requiring the user to configure
his/her ACLs. In this case you will need to specify those superuser's
usernames like this: `SOGoSuperUsernames = (<username1>[, <username2>, ...]);`

|U |SOGoLanguage
|Parameter used to set the default language used in the Web interface
for SOGo. Possible values are:

Defaults to `NO` when unset. User can overwrite this from the calendar
properties window.

|D |SOGoLDAPContactInfoAttribute
|Parameter used to specify an LDAP attribute that should be displayed
when auto-completing user searches.

|D |SOGoiPhoneForceAllDayTransparency
|When set to `YES`, this will force all-day events sent over by iPhone
OS based devices to be transparent. This means that the all-day events
will not be considered during freebusy lookups.

Defaults to `NO` when unset.

|S |SOGoEnablePublicAccess
|Parameter used to allow or not your users to share publicly (ie.,
requiring not authentication) their calendars and address books.

Possible values are:

[options="compact"]
* `YES` - to allow them
* `NO` - to prevent them from doing so

Defaults to `NO` when unset.

|S |SOGoDisableSharing
|List of modules where sharing should be disabled, for example `(Mail, Calendar)`. Modules can be `Mail`, `Contacts` and `Calendar`. Default value empty list (sharing enabled for everybody).

|S |SOGoDisableSharingAnyAuthUser
|List of modules where sharing with any authenticated user option should be disabled, for example `(Mail, Calendar)`. Modules can be `Mail`, `Contacts` and `Calendar`. Default value empty list (sharing enabled for everybody).

|S |SOGoDisableExport

|S |SOGoPasswordChangeEnabled
|Parameter used to allow or not users to change their passwords from
SOGo.

Possible values are:

[options="compact"]
* `YES` - to allow them
* `NO` - to prevent them from doing so

Defaults to `NO` when unset.

For this feature to work properly when authenticating against AD or
Samba4, the LDAP connection must use SSL/TLS. Server side restrictions
can also cause the password change to fail, in which case SOGo will only
log a 'Constraint violation (0x13)' error. These restrictions include
password too young, complexity constraints not satisfied, user cannot
change password, etc...  Also note that Samba has a minimum password age
of 1 day by default.

|S |SOGoSupportedLanguages
|Parameter used to configure which languages are available from SOGo's
Web interface. Available languages are specified as an array of string.

|D |SOGoHideSystemEMail
|Parameter used to control if SOGo should hide or not the system email
address (UIDFieldName@SOGoMailDomain). This is currently limited to
CalDAV (calendar-user-address-set).

Defaults to `NO` when unset.

|D |SOGoSearchMinimumWordLength
|Parameter used to control the minimum length to be used for the search
string (attendee completion, address book search, etc.) prior triggering
the server-side search operation.

Defaults to `2` when unset - which means a search operation will be
triggered on the 3rd typed character.

|S |SOGoMaximumFailedLoginCount
|Parameter used to control the number of failed login attempts required
during _SOGoMaximumFailedLoginInterval_ seconds or more. If conditions
are met, the account will be blocked for _SOGoFailedLoginBlockInterval_
seconds since the first failed login attempt.

Default value is `0`, or disabled.

|S |SOGoMaximumFailedLoginInterval
|Number of seconds, defaults to `10`.

|S |SOGoFailedLoginBlockInterval
|Number of seconds, defaults to `300` (or 5 minutes). Note that
_SOGoCacheCleanupInterval_ must be set to a value equal or higher than
_SOGoFailedLoginBlockInterval_.

|S |SOGoMaximumMessageSubmissionCount
|Parameter used to control the number of email messages a user can send
from SOGo's webmail interface, to _SOGoMaximumRecipientCount_, in
_SOGoMaximumSubmissionInterval_ seconds or more. If conditions are met

_SOGoCacheCleanupInterval_.

|S |SOGoMaximumRequestCount
|Parameter used to control the number of requests a user can send to the SOGo
server in _SOGoMaximumRequestInterval_ seconds or more. If conditions are met
or exceeded, the user will not be able to perform requests on the SOGo server
for _SOGoRequestBlockInterval_ seconds and will receive 429 HTTP responses for
any requests being made. Default value is 0, or disabled

|S |SOGoMaximumRequestInterval
|Number of seconds, defaults to `30`.

|S |SOGoRequestBlockInterval
|Number of seconds, defaults to 300 (or 5 minutes). Note that _SOGoCacheCleanupInterval_
must be set to a value equal or higher than _SOGoRequestBlockInterval_.

|S |SOGoXSRFValidationEnabled
|Parameter used to enable or not XSRF (Cross-site request forgery, also known as CSRF) protection in
 SOGo. Make sure your Web server configuration *doesn't* add the `HttpOnly` flag to the `Set-Cookie`
 header as the CSRF token cookie is intended to be read by the JavaScript by design.
Default value is `YES`, or enabled.

|Disable identity creation for users in preferences. If `YES`, users won't be able to add new identities and will allow to change only full name, signature and default identity. Default value is `NO`. Note : If this settings is set to `YES`, it will not be possible to crete auxiliary mail accounts.



|=======================================================================

Authentication using LDAP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SOGo can use a LDAP server to authenticate users and, if desired, to
provide global address books. SOGo can also use an SQL backend for this
purpose (see the section _<<Authentication-using-SQL,Authentication using SQL>>_ later in this
document). Insert the following text into your configuration file to
configure an authentication and global address book using an LDAP
directory server:

----
SOGoUserSources = (
    {
        type = ldap;
        CNFieldName = cn;
        IDFieldName = uid;
        UIDFieldName = uid;
        IMAPHostFieldName = mailHost;
        baseDN = "ou=users,dc=acme,dc=com";
        bindDN = "uid=sogo,ou=users,dc=acme,dc=com";
        bindPassword = qwerty;
        canAuthenticate = YES;
        displayName = "Shared Addresses";
        hostname = "ldap://127.0.0.1:389";
        id = public;
        isAddressBook = YES;
    }
);
----

In our example, we use a LDAP server running on the same host where SOGo
is being installed.

You can also, using the filter attribute, restrict the results to match
various criteria. For example, you could define, in your
`.GNUstepDefaults` file, the following filter to return only entries
belonging to the organization _Alinto_ with a _mail_ address and
not _inactive_:

 filter = "(o='Alinto' AND mail='*' AND status <> 'inactive')";

Since LDAP sources can serve as user repositories for authentication as
well as address books, you can specify the following for each source to
make them appear in the address book module:

----
displayName = "<human identification name of the addressÂ book>";
isAddressBook = YES;
----

For certain LDAP sources, SOGo also supports indirect binds for user
authentication. Here is an example:

----
SOGoUserSources = (
    {
        type = ldap;
        CNFieldName = cn;
        IDFieldName = cn;
        UIDFieldName = sAMAccountName;
        baseDN = "cn=Users,dc=acme,dc=com";
        bindDN = "cn=sogo,cn=Users,dc=acme,dc=com";
        bindFields = (sAMAccountName);
        bindPassword = qwerty;
        canAuthenticate = YES;
        displayName = "Active Directory";
        hostname = ldap://10.0.0.1:389;
        id = directory;
        isAddressBook = YES;
    }
);
----

In this example, SOGo will use an indirect bind by first determining the
user DN. That value is found by doing a search on the fields specified
in `bindFields`. Most of the time, there will be only one field but it
is possible to specify more in the form of an array (for example,
`bindFields = (sAMAccountName, cn)`). When using multiple fields, only
one of the fields needs to match the login name. In the above example,
when a user logs in, the login will be checked against the
`sAMAccountName` entry in all the user cards, and once this card is
found, the user DN of this card will be used for checking the user's
password.

Finally, SOGo supports LDAP-based groups. Groups must be defined like
any other authentication sources (ie., _canAuthenticate_ must be set
to `YES` and a group must have a valid email address). In order for SOGo
to determine if a specific LDAP entry is a group, SOGo will look for one
of the following objectClass attributes:

* `group`
* `groupOfNames`
* `groupOfUniqueNames`
* `posixGroup`

You can set ACLs based on group membership and invite a group to a
meeting (and the group will be decomposed to its list of members upon
save by SOGo). You can also control the visibility of the group from the
list of shared address books or during mail autocompletion by setting
the `isAddressBook` parameter to `YES` or `NO`. The following LDAP entry
shows how a typical group is defined:

----
dn: cn=inverse,ou=groups,dc=inverse,dc=ca
objectClass: groupOfUniqueNames
objectClass: top
objectClass: extensibleObject
uniqueMember: uid=alice,ou=users,dc=inverse,dc=ca
uniqueMember: uid=bernard,ou=users,dc=inverse,dc=ca
uniqueMember: uid=bob,ou=users,dc=inverse,dc=ca
cn: inverse
structuralObjectClass: groupOfUniqueNames
mail: inverse@inverse.ca
----

The corresponding _SOGoUserSources_ entry to handle groups like this one
would be:

----
{
    type = ldap;
    CNFieldName = cn;
    IDFieldName = cn;
    UIDFieldName = cn;
    baseDN = "ou=groups,dc=inverse,dc=ca";
    bindDN = "cn=sogo,ou=services,dc=inverse,dc=ca";
    bindPassword = zot;
    canAuthenticate = YES;
    displayName = "Alinto Groups";
    hostname = ldap://127.0.0.1:389;
    id = inverse_groups;
    isAddressBook = YES;
}
----

The following table describes the possible parameters related to a LDAP
source defined as a dictionary entry of the _SOGoUserSources_ parameter:

[cols="1,2a"]
|=======================================================================
|type
|The type of this user source, set to ldap` for an LDAP source.

|id
|The identification name of the LDAP repository. This must be unique -
even when using multiple domains.

|CNFieldName
|The field that returns the complete name.

|IDFieldName
|The field that starts a user DN if bindFields is not used. This field
must be unique across the entire SOGo domain.

|UIDFieldName
|The field that returns the login name of a user.

The returned value *must be unique across the whole SOGo installation*
since it is used to identify the user in the `folder_info` database
table.

|MailFieldNames (optional)
|An array of fields that returns the user's email addresses (defaults to
`mail` when unset). Note that SOGo will always automatically strip the
protocol value from the attribute if the attribute name is `proxyAddresses`.

|SearchFieldNames (optional)
|An array of fields to match against the search string when filtering
users (defaults to `sn`, `displayName`, `cn`, `mail`, and `telephoneNumber`
when unset).

|IMAPHostFieldName (optional)
|The field that returns either an URI to the IMAP server as described
for SOGoIMAPServer, or a simple server hostname that would be used as a
replacement for the hostname part in the URI provided by the
_SOGoIMAPServer_ parameter.

|IMAPLoginFieldName (optional)
|The field that returns the IMAP login name for the user (defaults to
the value of _UIDFieldName_ when unset).

|SieveHostFieldName (optional)
|The field that returns either an URI to the SIEVE server as described
for _SOGoSieveServer_, or a simple server hostname that would be used as
a replacement for the hostname part in the URI provided by the
_SOGoSieveServer_ parameter.

|baseDN
|The base DN of your user entries. You can use `%d` in this value if you
want the base DN to be built dynamically from the user's domain during
the login process. If you use that, you might always enable bindAsCurrentUser.

For example: `baseDN = "ou=%d,ou=domains,dc=example,dc=com";`

Moreover, if you use the dynamic base DN, you should use set
UIDFieldName to `mail` in order to be able to extract the domain
name automatically during the backup/restore process.

|KindFieldName (optional)
|If set, SOGo will try to determine if the value of the field
corresponds to either "group", "location" or "thing". If that's the
case, SOGo will consider the returned entry to be a resource.

For LDAP-based sources, SOGo can also automatically determine if it's a
resource if the entry has the `CalendarResource` objectClass set.

|MultipleBookingsFieldName (optional)
|The value of this attribute is the maximum number of concurrent events
to which a resource can be part of at any point in time.

If this is set to `0`, or if the attribute is missing, it means no
limit. If set to `-1`, no limit is imposed but the resource will
be marked as busy the first time it is booked.

|filter (optional)
|The filter to use for LDAP queries, it should be defined as an
EOQualifier. The following operators are supported:

[options="compact"]
* `<>` - inequality operator
* `=` - equality operator

Multiple qualifiers can be joined by using `OR` and `AND`, they can also
be grouped together by using parenthesis. Attribute values should be
quoted to avoid unexpected behaviour.

For example: `filter = "(objectClass='mailUser' OR objectClass='mailGroup') AND accountStatus='active' AND uid <> 'alice'";`

|scope (optional)
|Either `BASE`, `ONE` or `SUB`.

|bindDN
|The DN of the login name to use for binding to your server.

|bindPassword
|Its password.

|bindAsCurrentUser
|If set to `YES`, SOGo will always keep binding to the LDAP server using
the DN of the currently authenticated user. If _bindFields_ is set,
_bindDN_ and _bindPassword_ will still be required to find the proper DN
 of the user.

|bindFields (optional)
|An array of fields to use when doing indirect binds.

|lookupFields (optional)
|Lookup fields for LDAP queries. Default is `(*)`. This can be utilized
to lookup operational fields (which are per default not part of the result)
such as `memberOf`: `lookupFields = ("*", "memberOf");`

|hostname
|A space-delimited list of LDAP URLs or LDAP hostnames.

LDAP URLs are specified in RFC 4516 and have the following general
format:

`scheme://host:port/DN?attributes?scope?filter?extensions`

Note that SOGo doesn't currently support DN, attributes, scope and
filter in such URLs.  Using them may have undefined side effects.

URLs examples:

[options="compact"]
* `ldap://127.0.0.1:3389`
* `ldaps://127.0.0.1`
* `ldap://127.0.0.1/????!StartTLS`

|port (deprecated)
|Port number of the LDAP server.

A non-default port should be part of the ldap URL in the hostname
parameter.

|encryption (deprecated)
|Either `SSL` or `STARTTLS`

SSL should be specified as `ldaps://` in the LDAP URL. STARTTLS should
be specified as a LDAP Extension in the LDAP URL (e.g.
`ldap://127.0.0.1/????!StartTLS`)

|userPasswordAlgorithm
|The algorithm used for password encryption when changing passwords
without Password Policies enabled.

Possible values are: `none`, `plain`, `crypt`, `md5`, `md5-crypt`,
`sha256-crypt` and `sha512-crypt`, `smd5`, `cram-md5` and `sha`, `sha256`,
`sha512` and its ssha (e.g. `ssha` or `ssha256`) variants
(plus setting of the encoding with `.b64` or `.hex`).

For a more detailed description see
https://doc.dovecot.org/configuration_manual/authentication/password_schemes/.

Note that `cram-md5` is not actually using cram-md5 (due to the lack of
challenge-response mechanism), its just saving the intermediate MD5
context as Dovecot stores in its database.

Also note that `sha256-crypt` and `sha512-crypt` requires that your
operating system supports glibc 2.7 or more recent.

|canAuthenticate
|If set to `YES`, this LDAP source is used for authentication

|passwordPolicy
|If set to `YES`, SOGo will use the extended LDAP Password Policies
attributes. If you LDAP server does not support those and you activate
this feature, every LDAP requests will fail. Note that some LDAP servers
require LDAP/SSL for password policies to work. This is the case for
example with 389 Directory Server.

|updateSambaNTLMPasswords
|If set to `YES`, SOGo will automatically update the sambaNTPassword
and sambaLMPassword attributes when changing passwords. The attributes
must be called sambaNTPassword and sambaLMPassword. You must also make
sure the correct ACL is set in your LDAP server to allow users to change
their own sambaNTPassword and sambaLMPassword password attributes.
Defaults to `NO` when unset.

|isAddressBook
|If set to `YES`, this LDAP source is used as a shared address book
(with read-only access). Note that if set to `NO`, autocompletion will
not work for entries in this source and thus, freebusy lookups.

!displayName (optional)
!If set as an address book, the human identification name of the LDAP
repository

|listRequiresDot (optional)
|If set to `YES`, listing of this LDAP source is only possible when performing a search (respecting the SOGoSearchMinimumWordLength parameter) or when explicitly typing a single dot.
Defaults to `YES` when unset.

|ModulesConstraints (optional)
|Limits the access of any module through a constraint based on an LDAP
attribute; must be a dictionary with keys `Mail`, and/or `Calendar`,
and/or `ActiveSync` for example:

----
ModulesConstraints = {
	Calendar = {
		ou = employees;
	};
};
----

|mapping
|A dictionary that maps contact attributes used by SOGo to the LDAP
attributes used by the schema of the LDAP source.  Each entry must have
an attribute name as key and an array of strings as value. This enables
actual fields to be mapped one after another when fetching contact
information.

See the LDAP Attribute Mapping section below for an example and a list
of supported attributes.

|objectClasses
|When the _modifiers_ list (see below) is set, or when using LDAP-based
user address books (see _abOU_ below), this list of object classes will
be applied to new records as they are created.

|GroupObjectClasses
|A list (array) of names identifying groups within the LDAP source. If not
set, SOGo will use `group`, `groupofnames`, `groupofuniquenames`
and `posixgroup`.

|modifiers
|A list (array) of usernames that are authorized to perform
modifications to the address book defined by this LDAP source.

|abOU
|This field enables LDAP-based user address books by specifying the value
of the address book container beneath each user entry, for example:
`ou=addressbooks,uid=username,dc=domain`.
|=======================================================================

The following parameters can be defined along the other keys of each
entry of the SOGoUserSources, but can also defined at the domain and/or
system levels:

[cols="^4,46,50a"]
|=======================================================================
|D |SOGoLDAPContactInfoAttribute
|Parameter used to specify an attribute that should appear in
autocompletion of the web interface.

|D |SOGoLDAPQueryLimit
|Parameter used to limit the number of returned results from the LDAP
server whenever SOGo performs a LDAP query (for example, during
addresses completion in a shared address book).

|D |SOGoLDAPQueryTimeout
|Parameter to define the timeout of LDAP queries. The actual time limit
for operations is also bounded by the maximum time that the server is
configured to allow.

Defaults to `0` (unlimited).

|D |SOGoLDAPGroupExpansionEnabled
|Parameter used to enable group expansion from the Web interface.

Defaults to `NO` when unset.

|=======================================================================

LDAP Attributes Indexing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To ensure proper performance of the SOGo application, the following LDAP
attributes must be fully indexed:

[options="compact"]
* givenName
* cn
* mail
* sn
* attributes of `MailFieldNames` if defined
* attributes of `SearchFieldNames` if defined

Please refer to the documentation of the software you use in order to
index those attributes.

LDAP Attributes Mapping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some LDAP attributes are mapped to contacts attributes in the SOGo UI.
The table below list most of them. It is possible to override these by
using the _mapping_ configuration parameter.Â 

For example, if the LDAP schema uses the _fax_ attribute to store the
fax number, one could map it to the _facsimiletelephonenumber_ attribute
like this:

----
mapping = {
Â Â facsimiletelephonenumber = ("fax", "facsimiletelephonenumber");
};
----

Authenticating using C.A.S.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SOGo natively supports C.A.S. authentication. For activating C.A.S.
authentication you need first to make sure that the
_SOGoAuthenticationType_ setting is set to `cas`,
_SOGoXSRFValidationEnabled_ is set to `NO` and that the
_SOGoCASServiceURL_ setting is configured appropriately.

The tricky part shows up when using SOGo as a frontend interface to an
IMAP server as this imposes constraints needed by the C.A.S. protocol to
ensure secure communication between the different services. Failing to
take those precautions will prevent users from accessing their mails,
while still granting basic authentication to SOGo itself.

The first constraint is that *the amount of workers that SOGo uses must
be higher than 1 in order to enable the C.A.S.* service to perform some
validation requests during IMAP authentication. A single worker alone
would not, by definition, be able to respond to the C.A.S. requests
while treating the user request that required the triggering of those
requests. You must therefore configure the _WOWorkersCount_ setting
appropriately.

The second constraint is that *the SOGo service must be accessible and
accessed via https*. Moreover, the certificate used by the SOGo server
has to be recognized and trusted by the C.A.S. service. In the case of a
certificate issued by a third-party authority, there should be nothing
to worry about. In the case of a self-signed certificate, the
certificate must be registered in the trusted keystore of the C.A.S.
application. The procedure to achieve this can be summarized as
importing the certificate in the proper "keystore" using
the `keytool` utility and specifying the path for that keystore to the
Tomcat instance which provides the C.A.S. service. This is done by
tweaking the `javax.net.ssl.trustStore` setting, either in the
`catalina.properties` file or in the command-line parameters. On debian,
the SOGo certificate can also be added to the truststore as follows:

----
openssl x509 -in /etc/ssl/certs/sogo-cert.pem -outform DER \
  -out /tmp/sogo-cert.der
keytool -import -keystore /etc/ssl/certs/java/cacerts  \
  -file /tmp/sogo-cert.der -alias sogo-cert
# The keystore password is 'changeit'
# tomcat must be restarted after this operation
----

*The certificate used by the CAS server must also be trusted by SOGo.*
In case of a self-signed certificate, this means exporting tomcat's
certificate using the `keytool` utility, converting it to PEM format and
appending it to the `ca-certificates.crt` file (the name and location of
that file differs between distributions). Basically:

----
# export tomcat's cert to openssl format
keytool -keystore /etc/tomcat7/keystore  -exportcert -alias tomcat | \
 openssl x509 -inform der >tomcat.pem

Enter keystore password:  tomcat

# add the pem to the trusted certs
cp tomcat.pem /etc/ssl/certs
cat tomcat.pem  >>/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates
----

If any of those constraints is not satisfied, the webmail interface of
SOGo will display an empty email account. Unfortunately, SOGo has no
possibility to detect which one is the cause of the problem. The only
indicators are log messages that at least pinpoint the symptoms:

___________________________________________________
_"failure to obtain a PGT from the C.A.S. service"_
___________________________________________________

Such an error will show up during authentication of the user to SOGo. It
happens when the authentication service has accepted the user
authentication ticket but has not returned a "Proxy Granting Ticket".

_______________________________________________
_"a CAS failure occurred during operation...."_
_______________________________________________

This error indicate that an attempt was made to retrieve an
authentication ticket for a third-party service such as IMAP or sieve.
Most of the time, this happens as a consequence to the problem described
above. To troubleshoot these issues, one should be tailing `cas.log`,
pam logs and sogo logs.

Currently, SOGo will ask for a CAS ticket using the same CAS service
name for both IMAP and Sieve. *When CASifying sieve, this means that the
`-s` parameter of `pam_cas` should be the same for both IMAP and Sieve*,
otherwise the CAS server will complain:

----
ERROR [org.jasig.cas.CentralAuthenticationServiceImpl] - ServiceTicket
[ST-31740-hoV1brhhwMNfnBkSMVUw-ocas] with service [imap://myimapserver
does not match supplied service [sieve://mysieveserver:4190]
----

Finally, when using imapproxy to speed up the imap accesses, the
SOGoIMAPCASServiceName should be set to the actual imap service name
expected by pam_cas, otherwise it will fail to authenticate incoming
connection properly.

Authenticating using SAML2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SOGo natively supports SAML2 authentication. Please refer to the documentation of your identity
provider and the SAML2 configuration keys that are listed above for proper setup. Once a SOGo
instance is configured properly, the metadata for that instance can be retrieved from
`http://<hostname>/SOGo/saml2-metadata` for registration with the identity provider. SOGo will
dynamically generate the metadata based on the SOGoSAML2CertificateLocation's content and the SOGo
server name.

When using https://simplesamlphp.org/[SimpleSAMLphp], make sure the
convert OID to names by modifying your
`metadata/saml20-idp-hosted.php` to contain something like this:

----
        'attributes.NameFormat' => 'urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:uri',
        'authproc' => array(
                100 => array('class' => 'core:AttributeMap', 'oid2name'),
        ),
----

If you want to test the IdP-initiated logout using SimpleSAMLphp, you can do so by opening
the following URL:

----
https://idp.example.org/simplesaml/saml2/idp/SingleLogoutService.php?ReturnTo=sogo.nu
----

In order to relay authentication information to your IMAP server and if
you make use of the CrudeSAML SASL plugin, you need to make sure that
_NGImap4AuthMechanism_ is configured to use the `SAML` mechanism. If you
make use of the CrudeSAML PAM plugin, this value may be left empty.


Database Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SOGo requires a relational database system in order to store
appointments, tasks and contacts information. It also uses the database
system to store personal preferences of SOGo users. In this guide, we
assume you use PostgreSQL so commands provided the create the database
are related to this application. However, other database servers are
supported, such as MySQL and Oracle.

First, make sure that your PostgreSQL server has TCP/IP connections
support enabled.

[TIP]
===============================
SOGo stores the database hostname together with table references inside
several database tables. To prevent possible future issues when moving
the database to another host, it is best practice to add a local alias name to
your `/etc/hosts` file, and using this in `/etc/sogo/sogo.conf` instead of the
actual name of your server or localhost. When the database host name changes,
you can now simply change the hosts file instead of updating several table
columns replacing the old hostname. An example entry for `/etc/hosts` when
running the database on the same host, registering `127.0.0.1` not only for
`localhost`, but also the `db-alias` alias:

 127.0.0.1		localhost db-alias

In the SOGo configuration, use the alias name instead of the real IP address or
host name, for example

----
SOGoProfileURL =
    "postgresql://sogo:sogo@db-alias:5432/sogo/sogo_user_profile";
----
===============================

Create the database user and schema using the following commands:

----
su - postgres
createuser --no-superuser --no-createdb --no-createrole \
	--encrypted --pwprompt sogo
(specify âsogoâ as password)
createdb -O sogo sogo
----

You should then adjust the access rights to the database. To do so,
modify the configuration file `/var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf` in order
to add the following line at the very beginning of the file:

 hostÂ  Â sogoÂ  Â sogoÂ  Â  Â 127.0.0.1/32Â  Â  Â md5

Once added, restart the PostgreSQL database service. Then, modify the
SOGo configuration file (`/etc/sogo/sogo.conf`) to reflect your database
settings:

----
SOGoProfileURL =
    "postgresql://sogo:sogo@127.0.0.1:5432/sogo/sogo_user_profile";
OCSFolderInfoURL =
    "postgresql://sogo:sogo@127.0.0.1:5432/sogo/sogo_folder_info";
OCSSessionsFolderURL =
    "postgresql://sogo:sogo@127.0.0.1:5432/sogo/sogo_sessions_folder";
----

The following table describes the parameters that were set:

[cols="^4,46,50a"]
|=======================================================================
|S |SOGoProfileURL
|Parameter used to set the database URL so that SOGo can retrieve user
profiles.

For MySQL, set the database URL to something like:
`mysql://sogo:sogo@127.0.0.1:3306/sogo/sogo_user_profile`.

|S |OCSFolderInfoURL
|Parameter used to set the database URL so that SOGo can retrieve the
location of user folders (address books and calendars).

For Oracle, set the database URL to something like:
`oracle://sogo:sogo@127.0.0.1:1526/sogo/sogo_folder_info`.

|S |OCSSessionsFolderURL
|Parameter used to set the database URL so that SOGo can store and
retrieve secured user sessions information. For PostgreSQL, the database
URL could be set to something like:
`postgresql://sogo:sogo@127.0.0.1:5432/sogo/sogo_sessions_folder`.

|S |OCSEMailAlarmsFolderURL
|Parameter used to set the database URL for email-based alarms (that can
be set on events and tasks). This parameter is relevant only if
_SOGoEnableEMailAlarms_ is set to `YES`. For PostgreSQL, the database
URL could be set to something like:
`postgresql://sogo:sogo@127.0.0.1:5432/sogo/sogo_alarms_folder`

See the "EMail reminders" section in this document for more information.

|S |SOGoDisableOrganizerEventCheck
|Parameter used to disable organizer's calendar event check

|S |OCSStoreURL
|Parameter used to set the database URL so that SOGo can use to store
all content data. You must also set `OCSAclURL` and `OCSCacheFolderURL`
if you set this parameter. Using these parameters will allow SOGo to use
a total of nine database tables - and prevent SOGo from creating three
database tables per collection.

For PostgresSQL, set the database URL to something like:
`postgresql://sogo:sogo@127.0.0.1:5432/sogo/sogo_store`.

|S |OCSAclURL
|Parameter used to set the database URL so that SOGo can use to store
all ACL data. You must also set `OCSStoreURL` and `OCSCacheFolderURL`
if you set this parameter.

For PostgresSQL, set the database URL to something like:
`postgresql://sogo:sogo@127.0.0.1:5432/sogo/sogo_acl`.

|S |OCSCacheFolderURL
|Parameter used to set the database URL so that SOGo can use to store
all cache data. You must also set `OCSStoreURL` and `OCSAclURL`
if you set this parameter.

For PostgresSQL, set the database URL to something like:
`postgresql://sogo:sogo@127.0.0.1:5432/sogo/sogo_cache_folder`.
|=======================================================================


[NOTE]
Any non-URL safe characters in username/password must be URL-encoded.
For example, if your SOGo database password is `so%go`, you must set
the value in your preferences to `so%25go` - where `%` is encoded
to `%25`.

In addition to the seven tables described above, two other tables get
created in the database: `sogo_quick_appointment` and `sogo_quick_contact`
which store calendar and contact information.

If you're using MySQL, make sure in your `my.cnf` file you have:

----
[mysqld]
...
character_set_server=utf8
character_set_client=utf8

[client]
default-character-set=utf8

[mysql]
default-character-set=utf8
----

MySQL complete Unicode compliance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default MySQL only supports a subset of UTF-8, meaning that characters such
as emoji are not handled properly.  Some extra steps at installation can be
undertaken to leverage full Unicode support under MySQL.

IMPORTANT: Switching to complete Unicode compliance on an already-deployed SOGo
is out of scope of this document, as it would typically involve delicate manual
operations on the database system.

Requirements:

* MySQL >= 5.5
* SOGo >= 3.1.0

Strongly suggested MySQL configuration settings (innodb* parameters are
mandatory *only* for versions lower than 8.0):

----
[client]
default-character-set          = utf8mb4

[mysql]
default-character-set          = utf8mb4

[mysqld]
character-set-client-handshake = FALSE
character-set-server           = utf8mb4
collation-server               = utf8mb4_unicode_ci
innodb_file_per_table          = TRUE       # MySQL < 8.0 only
innodb_file_format             = barracuda  # MySQL < 8.0 only
innodb_large_prefix            = TRUE       # MySQL < 8.0 only
----

CAUTION: Changing InnoDB parameters on an already deployed database server can
cause severe data loss.  Do not blindly edit MySQL parameters without reading
and understanding the implication of such changes.

A parameter must be added to `sogo.conf` to turn on complete Unicode
compliance:

----
MySQL4Encoding = "utf8mb4";
----

SOGo automatically creates missing database tables on start but slightly
different table creation parameters are needed for complete Unicode compliance;
meaning that before SOGo runs for the first time, all database tables must
already exist.  A MySQL script to achieve just that is provided in the SOGo
distribution under `Scripts/mysql-utf8mb4.sql` and you can deploy it with
a command such as:

----
mysql -hHOST -uUSER -p -D SOGO < Scripts/mysql-utf8mb4.sql
----

Where `HOST`, `USER` and `SOGO` are your MySQL host, username and database name
respectively.

Once SOGo is running, you can test correctness by creating an event such as
âLunch with &#127829; and friesâ and seeing it properly displayed in the SOGo
calendar.

Ensure the computer used for the test has emoji fonts installed.

[[Authentication-using-SQL]]

Authentication using SQL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SOGo can use a SQL-based database server for authentication. The
configuration is very similar to LDAP-based authentication.

The following table describes the possible parameters related to a SQL
source defined as a dictionary entry of the _SOGoUserSources_ parameter:

[cols="1,2a"]
|=======================================================================
|type
|The type of this user source, set to `sql` for a SQL source.

|id
|The identification name of the SQL repository. This must be unique -
even when using multiple domains.

|viewURL
|Database URL of the view used by SOGo. The view expects columns to be
present. Required columns are:

[options="compact"]
* `c_uid`: will be used for authentication - it's a username or
  username@domain.tld
* `c_name`: will be used to uniquely identify entries - which can be
  identical to `c_uid`
* `c_password`: password of the user, plain text, crypt, md5 or sha
  encoded
* `c_cn`: the user's common name
* `mail`: the user's email address

Other columns can exist and will actually be mapped automatically if
they have the same name as popular LDAP attributes (such as `givenName`,
`sn`, `department`, `title`, `telephoneNumber`, etc.).

|userPasswordPolicy

|An array of dictionaries that define regular expressions used to determine whether a new password
 is valid.

Each dictionary must contain the key "regex" associated to a string representing a regular
expression. It can also contain the key "label" to briefly describe the constraint to the user. Example:

----
userPasswordPolicy = (
  {
    label = "Minimum of 1 lowercase letter";
    regex = "[a-z]";
  },
  {
    label = "Minimum of 1 uppercase letter";
    regex = "[A-Z]";
  },
  {
    label = "Minimum of 1 digit";
    regex = "[0-9]";
  },
  {
    label = "Minimum of 2 special symbols";
    regex = "([%$&*(){}!?\@#].*){2,}";
  },
  {
    label = "Minimum length of 8 characters";
    regex = ".{8,}";
  }
);
----

Pre-defined constants can also be used :

----
userPasswordPolicy = (
  {
    label = "POLICY_MIN_LOWERCASE_LETTER";
    value = 1;
  },
  {
    label = "POLICY_MIN_UPPERCASE_LETTER";
    value = 1;
  },
  {
    label = "POLICY_MIN_DIGIT";
    value = 2;
  },
  {
    label = "POLICY_MIN_SPECIAL_SYMBOLS";
    value = 1;
  },
  {
    label = "POLICY_MIN_LENGTH";
    value = 8;
  }
);
----

|userPasswordAlgorithm
|The default algorithm used for password encryption when changing
passwords. Possible values are: `none`, `plain`, `crypt`, `md5`,
`md5-crypt`, `smd5`, `cram-md5`, `ldap-md5`, and `sha`, `sha256`,
`sha256-crypt`, `sha512`, `sha512-crypt`, its ssha (e.g. `ssha` or
`ssha256`) variants, `blf-crypt`, `PBKDF2`, and `sym-aes-128-cbc`.
The `argon2i` and `argon2id` password hashing algorithms are supported
if SOGo is compiled with `libsodium`. `argon2` is a synonym for `argon2i`.
Passwords can have the scheme prepended in the form
`{scheme}encryptedPass`.

If no scheme is given, _userPasswordAlgorithm_ is used instead. The
schemes listed above follow the algorithms described in
https://doc.dovecot.org/configuration_manual/authentication/password_schemes/.

Note that `cram-md5` is not actually using cram-md5 (due to the lack of
challenge-response mechanism), its just saving the intermediate MD5
context as Dovecot stores in its database.

|prependPasswordScheme
|The default behaviour is to store newly set passwords without the
scheme (default: `NO`). This can be overridden by setting to `YES` and
will result in passwords stored as `{scheme}encryptedPass`. For
`sym-aes-128-cbc`, always set this to `NO`.

|keyPath
|For `sym-aes-128-cbc`, a global key file is required. This value
must be set to the full path where the key file is. The key file
must also be readable by the `sogo` user.

|canAuthenticate
|If set to `YES`, this SQL source is used for authentication.

|isAddressBook
|If set to `YES`, this SQL source is used as a shared address book
(with read-only access). Note that if set to `NO`, autocompletion will
not work for entries in this source and thus, freebusy lookups.

|authenticationFilter (optional)
|A filter that limits which users can authenticate from this source.

|displayName (optional)
|If set as an address book, the human identification name of the SQL
repository.

|LoginFieldNames (optional)
|An array of fields that specifies the column names that contain valid
authentication usernames (defaults to `c_uid` when unset).

|MailFieldNames (optional)
|An array of fields that specifies the column names that hold
additional email addresses (beside the `mail` column) for each user.
Values must be unique and not appear in more than one column.
Space-separated values allowed in all *additional* columns (besides in `mail`).

|SearchFieldNames (optional)
|An array of fields to match against the search string when filtering
users (defaults to `c_cn` and `mail` when unset).

|IMAPHostFieldName (optional)
|The field that returns the IMAP hostname for the user.

|IMAPLoginFieldName (optional)
|The field that returns the IMAP login name for the user (defaults to
`c_uid` when unset).

|SieveHostFieldName (optional)
|The field that returns the Sieve hostname for the user.

|KindFieldName (optional)
|If set, SOGo will try to determine if the value of the field
corresponds to either "group", "location" or "thing". If that's the
case, SOGo will consider the returned entry to be a resource.

|MultipleBookingsFieldName (optional)
|The value of this field is the maximum number of concurrent events to
which a resource can be part of at any point in time.

If this is set to `0`, or if the attribute is missing, it means no
limit and the resource will always be marked as free. If set to `-1`,
no limit is imposed but the resource will be marked as busy the first
time it is booked. If greater than 0, the resource will get marked as
busy once it reaches the value.

|DomainFieldName (optional)
|If set, SOGo will use the value of that field as the domain associated
to the user.

See the _Multi-domains Configuration_ section in this document for more
information.

|listRequiresDot (optional)
|If set to `YES`, listing of this SQL source is only possible when performing a search (respecting the SOGoSearchMinimumWordLength parameter) or when explicitly typing a single dot.
Defaults to `YES` when unset.

|ModulesConstraints (optional)
|Limits the access of any module through a constraint based on a SQL
column whose value is a string (e.g. `char` or `varchar` column type);
must be a dictionary with keys `Mail`, and/or `Calendar`,
and/or `ActiveSync` for example:

----
ModulesConstraints = {
	Calendar = {
		c_ou = employees;
	};
};
----
|=======================================================================

Here is an example of an SQL-based authentication and address book
source:

----
SOGoUserSources =
(
  {
    type = sql;
    id = directory;
    viewURL = "postgresql://sogo:sogo@127.0.0.1:5432/sogo/sogo_view";
    canAuthenticate = YES;
    isAddressBook = YES;
    userPasswordAlgorithm = md5;
  }
);
----

Certain database columns must be present in the view/table, such as:

* `c_uid` - will be used for authentication -Â it's the username
or username@domain.tld
* `c_name` - which can be identical to `c_uid` -Â will be used to
  uniquely identify entries
* `c_password` - password of the user, plain-text, md5 or sha encoded
  for now
* `c_cn` - the user's common name - such as "John Doe"
* `mail` -Â the user's mail address

Note that groups are currently not supported for SQL-based
authentication sources.

SMTP Server Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SOGo makes use of a SMTP server to send emails from the Web interface,
iMIP/iTIP messages and various notifications.

The following table describes the related parameters.

[cols="^4,46,50a"]
|=======================================================================
|D |SOGoMailingMechanism
|Parameter used to set how SOGo sends mail messages. Possible values
are:

[options="compact"]
* `sendmail` - to use the sendmail binary

_SOGoMailingMechanism_ is set to `smtp`.
Supported formats are: `smtp://domain:port`, `smtps://domain`,
`domain:port`, `smtp://domain:port/?tls=YES`. Using the option
`tls=YES` will enforce using STARTTLS SMTP connections. Thus,
`smtp://localhost:587/?tls=YES` would use the default MUA port
on localhost with STARTTLS enforced.
To disable TLS verification for localhost domains, add
`tlsVerifyMode=allowInsecureLocalhost` to such connections:
`smtp://localhost:587/?tls=YES&tlsVerifyMode=allowInsecureLocalhost`.

|D |SOGoSMTPAuthenticationType
|Activate SMTP authentication and specifies which type is in use.
Current, only `PLAIN` is supported and other values will cause
the authentication to fail.

|S |WOSendMail
|The path of the sendmail binary.

Defaults to `/usr/lib/sendmail`.

|D |SOGoForceExternalLoginWithEmail
|Parameter used to specify if, when logging in to the SMTP server, the
primary email address of the user will be used instead of the username.
Possible values are:

[options="compact"]
* `YES`
* `NO`

Defaults to `NO` when unset.
|=======================================================================

IMAP Server Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SOGo requires an IMAP server in order to let users consult their email

IMAP separator is a `.`. Also see the SOGoMailJunkSettings for
more options regarding junk/not-junk actions.

|D |SOGoIMAPCASServiceName
|Parameter used to set the CAS service name (URL) of the imap service.
This is useful if SOGo is connecting to the IMAP service through a
proxy. When using `pam_cas`, this parameter should be set to the same
value as the `-s` argument of the imap pam service.

|D |SOGoIMAPServer
|Parameter used to set the DNS name or IP address of the IMAP server
used by SOGo. You can also use SSL or TLS by providing a value using a
URL with a fully qualified domain name, such as:

* `NO`

Defaults to `NO` when unset.

|D |SOGoIMAPAclStyle
|Parameter used to specify which RFC the IMAP server implements with
respect to ACLs. Possible values are:

[options="compact"]
* `rfc2086`
* `rfc4314`

Defaults to `rfc4314` when unset.

|D |SOGoIMAPAclConformsToIMAPExt
|Parameter used to specify if the IMAP server implements the Internet
Message Access Protocol Extension. Possible values are:

[options="compact"]
* `YES`
* `NO`

Defaults to `NO` when unset.

`NO` or using a caching proxy like imapproxy.

The default value is `YES`.

|S |NGImap4AuthMechanism
|Trigger the use of the IMAP `AUTHENTICATE` command with the specified
SASL mechanism. Using `AUTHENTICATE` instead of `LOGIN` is also necessary
to enable UTF-8 characters in users' passwords. To enable simple use of
`AUTHENTICATE` for this purpose, set this setting to `plain`. Please note 
that this feature might be limited at this time.

|D |NGImap4ConnectionGroupIdPrefix
|Prefix to prepend to names in IMAP ACL transactions, to indicate the
name is a group name, not a user name.

RFC4314 gives examples where group names are prefixed with `$`. Dovecot,
for one, follows this scheme, and will, for example, apply permissions
for `$admins` to all users in group `admins` in the absence of specific
permissions for the individual user.

The default prefix is `$`.Â

            port = 389;
        }
    );
}
----

Multi-domains Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want your installation to isolate two groups of users, you must
define a distinct authentication source for each _domain_. Your domain keys
must have the same value as your email domain you want to add. Following is
the same configuration that now includes two domains (acme.com and
coyote.com):

----
{
...
    domains = {
        acme.com = {
            SOGoMailDomain = acme.com;
            SOGoDraftsFolderName = Drafts;
            SOGoUserSources = (
                {
                    type = ldap;
                    CNFieldName = cn;
                    IDFieldName = uid;
                    UIDFieldName = uid;
                    baseDN = "ou=users,dc=acme,dc=com";
                    bindDN = "uid=sogo,ou=users,dc=acme,dc=com";
                    bindPassword = qwerty;
                    canAuthenticate = YES;
                    displayName = "Shared Addresses";
                    hostname = 127.0.0.1;
                    id = public_acme;
                    isAddressBook = YES;
                    port = 389;
                }
            );
        };
        coyote.com = {
            SOGoMailDomain = coyote.com;
            SOGoIMAPServer = imap.coyote.com;
            SOGoUserSources = (
                {
                    type = ldap;
                    CNFieldName = cn;
                    IDFieldName = uid;
                    UIDFieldName = uid;
                    baseDN = "ou=users,dc=coyote,dc=com";
                    bindDN = "uid=sogo,ou=users,dc=coyote,dc=com";
                    bindPassword = qwerty;
                    canAuthenticate = YES;
                    displayName = "Shared Addresses";
                    hostname = 127.0.0.1;
                    id = public_coyote;
                    isAddressBook = YES;
                    port = 389;
                }
            );
        };
    };
}
----

The following additional parameters only affect SOGo when using multiple
domains.

[cols="^4,46,50a"]
|=======================================================================
|S |SOGoEnableDomainBasedUID
|Parameter used to enable user identification by domain. Users will be
able (without being required) to login using the form `username@domain`,
meaning that values of _UIDFieldName_ no longer have to be unique among
all domains but only within the same domain. Internally, users will
always be identified by the concatenation of their username and domain.

Consequently, activating this parameter on an existing system implies
that user identifiersÂ will change and their previous calendars and
address books will no longer be accessible unless a conversion is
performed.

Defaults to `NO` when unset.

|S |SOGoLoginDomains
|Parameter used to define which domains should be selectable from the
login page. This parameter is an array of keys from the `domains`
dictionary.

Defaults to an empty array, which means that no domains appear on the
login page. If you prefer having the domain names listed, just use these
as keys for the the `domains` dictionary.

|S |SOGoDomainsVisibility
|Parameter used to set domains visible among themselves. This parameter
is an array of arrays.

Example: `SOGoDomainsVisibility = ( (acme, coyote) );`

Defaults to an empty array, which means domains are isolated from each
other.
|=======================================================================

Apache Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The SOGo configuration for Apache is located in
`/etc/httpd/conf.d/SOGo.conf`.

Upon SOGo installation, a default configuration file is created which is
suitable for most configurations.

You must also configure the following parameters in the SOGo
configuration file for Apache in order to have a working installation:

----
RequestHeader set "x-webobjects-server-port" "80"
RequestHeader set "x-webobjects-server-name" "yourhostname"
RequestHeader set "x-webobjects-server-url" "http://yourhostname"
----

You may consider enabling SSL on top of this current installation to
secure access to your SOGo installation.

See http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/ssl/ for details.

You might also have to adjust the configuration if you have SELinux
enabled.

The default configuration will use `mod_proxy` and `mod_headers` to
relay requests to the `sogod` parent process. This is suitable for small
to medium deployments.

Starting Services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once SOGo if fully installed and configured, start the services using
the following command:

 systemctl start sogod.service

You may verify using the `systemctl is-enabled sogod` command that the SOGo
service is automatically started at boot time. Restart the Apache service since
modules and configuration files were added:

 systemctl restart httpd.service

Finally, you should also make sure that the `memcached` service is
started and that it is also automatically started at boot time.

_Cronjob_ â EMail reminders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SOGo allows you to set email-based reminders for events and tasks. To
enable this, you must enable the `SOGoEnableEMailAlarms` preference and
set the `OCSEMailAlarmsFolderURL` preference accordingly.

Once you've correctly set those two preferences, you must create
a _cronjob_ that will run under the "sogo" user. This _cronjob_ should
be run every minute.

A commented out example should have been installed in
`/etc/cron.d/sogo`, to enable it, simply uncomment it.

As a reference, the _cronjob_ should de defined like this:

----
* * * * *Â  Â  Â /usr/sbin/sogo-ealarms-notify
----

If your mail server requires use of SMTP AUTH, you can use the following parameters in the configuration file :

```
SOGoSMTPMasterUserEnabled = YES;
SOGoSMTPMasterUserUsername = "foo";
SOGoSMTPMasterUserPassword = "bar";
```

_Cronjob_ â Vacation messages activation and expiration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When vacation messages are enabled (see the parameter
_SOGoVacationEnabled_), users can set an activation or expiration date
to messages auto-reply. For this feature to work, your Sieve server must
implement the _date_ extension. Otherwise, you must run a _cronjob_ under
the "sogo" user.

A commented out example should have been installed in
`/etc/cron.d/sogo`.Â To work correctly this tool must login as an
administrative user on the sieve server. The required credentials must
be specified in a file by using `-p /path/to/credFile`.Â This file should
contain the username and password, separated by a colon
(`username:password`).

The _cronjob_ should look like this:

----
0 0 * * *Â sogo /usr/sbin/sogo-tool update-autoreply -p /etc/sogo/sieve.creds
----

_Password_ â Force user password change at login
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following commands force user to change his password at login :

----
/usr/sbin/sogo-tool user-preferences set settings [USER] ForceResetPassword 1
----

Disable :

----
/usr/sbin/sogo-tool user-preferences unset settings [USER] ForceResetPassword
----

Managing User Accounts
----------------------

Creating the SOGo Administrative Account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, create the SOGo administrative account in your LDAP server. The
following LDIF file (`sogo.ldif`) can be used as an example:

----
dn: uid=sogo,ou=users,dc=acme,dc=com
objectClass: top
objectClass: inetOrgPerson
objectClass: person
objectClass: organizationalPerson
uid: sogo
cn: SOGo Administrator
mail: sogo@acme.com
sn: Administrator
givenName: SOGo
----

Load the LDIF file inside your LDAP server using the following command:

 ldapadd -f sogo.ldif -x -w qwerty -D cn=Manager,dc=acme,dc=com

Finally, set the password (to the value `qwerty`) of the SOGo
administrative account using the following command:

 ldappasswd -h 127.0.0.1 -x -w qwerty -D cn=Manager,dc=acme,dc=com uid=sogo,ou=users,dc=acme,dc=com -s qwerty

Creating a User Account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SOGo uses LDAP directories to authenticate users. Use the following LDIF
file (`jdoe.ldif`) as an example to create a SOGo user account:

----
dn: uid=jdoe,ou=users,dc=acme,dc=com
objectClass: top
objectClass: inetOrgPerson
objectClass: person
objectClass: organizationalPerson
uid: jdoe
cn: John Doe
mail: jdoe@acme.com
sn: Doe
givenName: John
----

Load the LDIF file inside your LDAP server using the following command:

 ldapadd -f jdoe.ldif -x -w qwerty -D cn=Manager,dc=acme,dc=com

Finally, set the password (to the value `qwerty`) of the SOGo
administrative account using the following command:

 ldappasswd -h 127.0.0.1 -x -w qwerty -D cn=Manager,dc=acme,dc=com uid=jdoe,ou=users,dc=acme,dc=com -s qwerty

As an alternative to using command-line tools, you can also use LDAP
editors such as _Luma_ or _Apache Directory Studio_ to make your work
easier. These GUI utilities can make use of templates to create and
pre-configure typical user accounts or any standardized LDAP record,
along with the correct object classes, fields and default values.

Microsoft Enterprise ActiveSync
-------------------------------

SOGo supports the Microsoft ActiveSync protocol.

ActiveSync clients can fully synchronize contacts, emails, events and
tasks with SOGo. Freebusy and GAL lookups are also supported, as well as
"Smart reply" and "Smart forward" operations.

To enable Microsoft ActiveSync support in SOGo, you must install the
required packages.

 yum install sogo-activesync libwbxml

Once installed, simply uncomment the following lines from your SOGo
Apache configuration:

----
ProxyPass /Microsoft-Server-ActiveSync \
	http://127.0.0.1:20000/SOGo/Microsoft-Server-ActiveSync \
	retry=60 connectiontimeout=5 timeout=360
----

Restart Apache afterwards.

The following additional parameters only affect SOGo when using
ActiveSync:

[cols="^4,46,50a"]
|=======================================================================
|S |SOGoMaximumPingInterval
|Parameter used to set the maximum amount of time, in seconds, SOGo will
wait before replying to a Ping command.

If not set, it defaults to `10` seconds.

|S |SOGoMaximumSyncInterval
|Parameter used to set the maximum amount of time, in seconds, SOGo will
wait before replying to a Sync command.

If not set, it defaults to `30` seconds.

|S |SOGoInternalSyncInterval
|Parameter used to set the maximum amount of time, in seconds, SOGo will
wait before doing an internal check for data changes (add, delete, and
update). This parameter must be lower than _SOGoMaximumSyncInterval_ and
_SOGoMaximumPingInterval_.

If not set, it defaults to `10` seconds.

|S |SOGoMaximumSyncResponseSize
|Parameter used to overwrite the maximum response size during
a Sync operation. The value is in kilobytes. Setting this to 512
means the response size will be of 524288 bytes or less. Note that
if you set the value too low and a mail message (or any other object)
surpasses it, it will still be synced but only this item will be.

Defaults to `0`, which means no overwrite is performed.

|S |SOGoMaximumSyncWindowSize
|Parameter used to overwrite the maximum number of items returned during
a Sync operation.

Defaults to `0`, which means no overwrite is performed.

Setting this parameter to a value greater than `512` will
have unexpected behaviour with various ActiveSync clients.
|S |SOGoEASDebugEnabled
|Parameter used to log the complete request and response of every single
EAS command.

Defaults to `NO`, which means no logging is performed.

|S |SOGoMaximumPictureSize
|Parameter used to overwrite the maximum number of bytes returned in the picture
for EAS Search operations in the GAL.

If not set, it defaults to `102400` bytes, or 100 KB.

|S |SOGoEASSearchInBody
|Parameter used to enable EAS Search operation in all parts of a message.

|S |SOGoEASDisableUI
|Parameter used to disable EAS user interface options. Default value is `NO`

Defaults to `NO`, which means to search only in Subject- and From-header.
|=======================================================================

Please be aware of the following limitations:

* Outlook 2013/2016 does not search the GAL. One possible alternative
solution is to configure Outlook to use a LDAP server (over SSL) with
authentication. Outlook 2013/2016 also does not seem to support multiple
address books over ActiveSync.
* To successfully synchronize Outlook email categories, a corresponding
mail label (Preferences->Mail Options) has to be created manually in SOGo
for each label defined in Outlook. The name in SOGo and in Outlook must be
identical.
* Make sure you do not use a self-signed certificate. While this will
work, Outlook will work intermittently as it will raise popups for
certificate validation, sometimes in background, preventing the user to
see the warning and thus, preventing any synchronization to happen.
* ActiveSync clients keep connections open for a while. Each connection
will grab a hold on a sogod process so you will need a lot of processes
to handle many clients. Make sure you tune your SOGo server when having
lots of ActiveSync clients.
* Repetitive events with occurrences exceptions are currently not
supported.
* Outlook 2013/2016 Autodiscovery is currently not supported.
* Outlook 2013/2016 freebusy lookups are supported using the Internet
Free/Busy feature of Outlook 2013/2016. Please
see http://support.microsoft.com/kb/291621 for configuration
instructions. On the SOGo side, _SOGoEnablePublicAccess_ must be set to
`YES` and the URL to use must be of the following format:
`http://<hostname>/SOGo/dav/public/%NAME%/freebusy.ifb`
* If you have very large mail folders (thousands of messages), you will
need to adjust the word size of your IMAP server. In Dovecot, the parameter
to increase is "imap_max_line_length" while under Cyrus IMAP Server, the
parameter is "maxword". We suggest a buffer of 2MB.
* If you are using MySQL, make sure you set "max_allowed_packet" to a large value
since the EAS cache size can be large for mailboxes with thousands of messages.
A 64M or even 128M value is recommended.

In order to use the SOGo ActiveSync support code in production
environments, you need to get a proper usage license from Microsoft.
Please contact them directly to negotiate the fees associated to your
user base.

Microsoft Enterprise ActiveSync Tuning
--------------------------------------

First of all, it is important to know that most EAS devices will keep
HTTP connections open to SOGo (and thus, Apache) for a long time. This
is required for "push" to work properly. Connections can stay open for
up to one hour, or 3600 seconds.

The first parameter to check is related to Apache's proxying to
SOGo:

----
ProxyPass /Microsoft-Server-ActiveSync \
 http://127.0.0.1:20000/SOGo/Microsoft-Server-ActiveSync \
 retry=60 connectiontimeout=5 timeout=360
----

The above line sets a timeout for up to 360 seconds, or 6 minutes. If
you want to let EAS clients keep their HTTP connections open for up
to an hour, you must change the timeout parameter and set it to 3600.

If you change this value, the _WOWatchDogRequestTimeout_ parameter must be changed
accordingly in SOGo's configuration file (`/etc/sogo/sogo.conf`). By default,
a SOGo child process is allowed to handle a request that can take up
to 10 minutes before it gets killed by its parent process. When using
EAS "push", the client expects to keep its connection open for up to one
hour - so the _WOWatchDogRequestTimeout_, which is set in minutes,
must be adjusted accordingly.

EAS clients will keep HTTP connections open for a long time
during these two EAS commands: *Ping* and *Sync*. By default, SOGo will prevent
EAS clients from keeping connections for a long time. This is to avoid the
situation where all SOGo child processes would be monopolized by EAS clients -
rendering the SOGo web interface or DAV interface unavailable. The
default SOGo behavior is thus similar to disable EAS push entirely.

Two SOGo configuration parameters are available to modify this behavior:
_SOGoMaximumPingInterval_ (set by default to 10 seconds) and
_SOGoMaximumSyncInterval_ (set by default to 30 seconds). If you want
connection to stay open for up to one hour, you should set these
slightly under 3600 seconds (say 3540 - or 59 minutes). During a
long-lived HTTP connection, the SOGo child process will perform
internal polling to detect changes and return them to the EAS client
if any changes are found. The parameter used to control this
is _SOGoInternalSyncInterval_. By default, polling is done every 10
seconds. This might generate too much load on large-scale system.

The last configuration parameter to adjust is WOWorkersCount - which sets the
number of SOGo child process that will be used to handle requests.
You should have at least one child per EAS device configured to use
"push". You must also have more children than you have EAS devices
configured to use "push" - in order to handle normal SOGo requests to
its Web or DAV interfaces.

Here are some usage examples for EAS devices using "push". In all
cases, the Apache timeout is set to 3600 and the
_WOWatchDogRequestTimeout_ parameter is set to 60.

Example 1 - 100 users, 10 EAS devices:

----
WOWorkersCount = 15;
SOGoMaximumPingInterval = 3540;
SOGoMaximumSyncInterval = 3540;
SOGoInternalSyncInterval = 30;
----

Example 2 - 1000 users, 100 EAS devices:

----
WOWorkersCount = 120;
SOGoMaximumPingInterval = 3540;
SOGoMaximumSyncInterval = 3540;
SOGoInternalSyncInterval = 60;
----

S/MIME Support in SOGo
----------------------

SOGo supports S/MIME email signing and encryption. When receiving
S/MIME signed emails, SOGo automatically extracts the PKCS (Public-Key
Cryptography Standard) #7 signature and stores it in the user's
personal address book for the contact associated to the email address
of the email's sender. This certificate will allow the user to send
encrypted emails to these recipients.

User that wish to send signed emails must upload their certificate in
PKCS #12 format. When doing so, SOGo will convert the PKCS #12 file
into the PEM format and store it in the user's preferences.

If you are looking for a free S/MIME certificate from a well-known CA,
please have a look at Actalis:
https://www.actalis.it/products/certificates-for-secure-electronic-mail.aspx


Using SOGo
----------

SOGo Web Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To acces the SOGo Web Interface, point your Web browser, which is
running from the same server where SOGo was installed, to the following
URL: http://127.0.0.1/SOGo.

Log in using the "jdoe" user and the "qwerty" password. The underlying
database tables will automatically be created by SOGo.

Mozilla Thunderbird and Lightning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alternatively, you can access SOGo with a GroupDAV and a CalDAV client.
A typical well-integrated setup is to use Mozilla Thunderbird and
Mozilla Lightning along with Alinto's _SOGo Connector_ plug in to
synchronize your address books and the Alinto's _SOGo Integrator_ plug
in to provide a complete integration of the features of SOGo into
Thunderbird and Lightning. Refer to the documentation of Thunderbird to
configure an initial IMAP account pointing to your SOGo server and using
the user name and password mentioned above.

With the SOGo Integrator plug in, your calendars and address books will
be automatically discovered when you login in Thunderbird. This plug in
can also propagate specific extensions and default user settings among
your site. However, be aware that in order to use the SOGo Integrator
plug in, you will need to repackage it with specific modifications.
Please refer to the documentation published online:

https://www.sogo.nu/support.html#/documentation

If you only use the SOGo Connector plug in, you can still easily access
your data.

To access your personal address book:

* Choose Go > Address Book.
* Choose File > New > Remote Address Book.
* Enter a significant name for your calendar in the Name field.
* Type the following URL in the URL field:
`http://127.0.0.1/SOGo/dav/jdoe/Contacts/personal/`
* Click on OK.

To access your personal calendar:

* Choose Go > Calendar.
* Choose Calendar > New Calendar.
* Select On the Network and click on Continue.
* Select CalDAV.
* Type the following URL in the URL field:
`http://127.0.0.1/SOGo/dav/jdoe/Calendar/personal/`
* Click on Continue.

Apple Calendar (macOS, iOS, iPadOS)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Apple Calendar on macOS, iOS, and iPadOS can also be used
as a client application for SOGo.

To configure the application so it works with SOGo, create a new account and specify,
as the Account URL, an URL such as:

http://127.0.0.1/SOGo/dav/jdoe/

Note that the trailing slash is important for the old Apple iCal 3 application.

Since SOGo 5.9.1, calendar can be installed using provisioning profiles. On the calendar interface next to the calendar name (eg `Personal`), click on the three dots button and click on `Download iOS - MacOS configuration profile`.
You have to add the profile to your device :

* Go to Settings / Profiles / Click on + / Continue
* Type your SOGo account password and click on install

Apple AddressBook
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard), Apple AddressBook can be configured
to use SOGo.

In order to make this work, you must add a new virtual host in your
Apache configuration file to listen on port 8800 and handle requests
coming from iOS devices.

The virtual host should be defined like:

----
<VirtualHost *:8800>
  RewriteEngine Off
  ProxyRequests Off
  SetEnv proxy-nokeepalive 1
  ProxyPreserveHost On
  ProxyPassInterpolateEnv On
  ProxyPass /principals http://127.0.0.1:20000/SOGo/dav/ interpolate
  ProxyPass /SOGo http://127.0.0.1:20000/SOGo interpolate
  ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:20000/SOGo/dav/ interpolate

  <Location />
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
  </Location>
  <Proxy http://127.0.0.1:20000>
    RequestHeader set "x-webobjects-server-port" "8800"
    RequestHeader set "x-webobjects-server-name" "acme.com:8800"
    RequestHeader set "x-webobjects-server-url" "http://acme.com:8800"
    RequestHeader set "x-webobjects-server-protocol" "HTTP/1.0"
    RequestHeader set "x-webobjects-remote-host" "127.0.0.1"
    AddDefaultCharset UTF-8
  </Proxy>
  ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/ab-error.log
  CustomLog /var/log/apache2/ab-access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
----

This configuration is also required if you want to configure a CardDAV
account on an Apple iOS device (version 4.0 and later).

Since SOGo 5.9.1, address book can be installed using provisioning profiles. On the address book interface next to the address book name (eg `Personal`), click on the three dots button and click on `Download iOS - MacOS configuration profile`.
You have to add the profile to your device :

* Go to Settings / Profiles / Click on + / Continue
* Type your SOGo account password and click on install

Microsoft ActiveSync
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can synchronize contacts, emails, events and tasks from SOGo with
any mobile devices that support Microsoft ActiveSync. Microsoft Outlook
2013/2016 is also supported.

The Microsoft ActiveSync server URL is generally something
like: `http://127.0.0.1/Microsoft-Server-ActiveSync`.

Using sogo-tool
---------------
The command _sogo-tool_ allows to do some operations on database and sieve filter. It is included with
the sogo package on Debian/Ubuntu but must be installed manually on RHEl/CentOS:

 yum install sogo-tool

*_WARNING_: Use sogo-tool with full awareness of what you are doing. This is an admin tool that can cause loss of data
or completely make the webmail unusable by a user.*

sogo-tool backup/restore
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The backup tool saves the information of a user into a file. The information saved are its preferences, its events and its contacts.

 sogo-tool backup directory ALL|user1 [user2] ...

* First argument, *directory* must be a path, only the last subdirectory will be created, the previous ones must exist.
* Second argument is *ALL* to backup all users or put each user space-separated.
* Each user's info will take one file, the filename will be the username.
* The files are readable but in a specific format for _sogo-tool restore_.

Example:
----
sogo-tool backup /tmp/foo ALL # Will save all users into /tmp/foo
sogo-tool backup /etc/sogo_backup/foo user1 user2 # Will save only user1 and user2. The directory /etc/sogo_backup must exist.
----

Using the files produced by the backup, you can restore all or some information of a user with the _restore_ command:

 sogo-tool restore [-l|-p|-f/-F folder/ALL] [-c credentialFile] directory user

* First argument must be one of the four mode options *-l*, *-p*, *-f* or *-F*.
* Second, optional, is *-c* with the credential file. Only useful with *-p* mode.
* *directory* is the path where the backup file is.
* *user* is the name of the backup file, which is the username if you use the _backup_ tool.

The differents mode are:

* *-l* will only list the folders (meaning calendar and address book) that would be restored with *-f* or *-F*.

Example:
----
sogo-tool restore -l /tmp/backup user1
----
Result:
----
Calendar/60C8-65323D80-7-4D9F7D80 (new_calendar)
Calendar/personal (Personal Calendar)
Contacts/personal (Personal Address Book)
----

* *-p* will restore the user's preferences. If the user has an active sieve script (filter, vacation, forward...) you must provide a credential file with
the parameters *-c*. The credential file  is a simple one-line file that contains the "username:password" of an admin account of your imap/sieve server.

Example:
----
sogo-tool restore -p /tmp/backup user1
sogo-tool restore -p -c /var/sogo/cred /tmp/backup user1
----

* *-f* will restore the events/contacts of folders (calendar and address book) from the backup file that don't exist in the database. If the event/contact 
was deleted but is in the backup file, it will be restored. If the event/contact exist, nothing will be done even if it has been modified compared to the
backup file. If a whole folder has been deleted but is in the backup file, it will be restored. *-f* expect a value that can be ALL to restore all folders,
or the name of the folder to restore. You can list them with the *-l* mode.

Example:
----
sogo-tool restore -f ALL /tmp/backup user1
sogo-tool restore -f "Contacts/personal" tmp/backup user1
sogo-tool restore -f "Calendar/60C8-65323D80-7-4D9F7D80" tmp/backup user1
----
The commands will either prints out nothing or any events/contacts restored:
----
restoring record '60CA-65323D00-1-680B0A00.ics'
restoring record '60C8-65323D00-1-4D9F7D80.vcf'
restoring record '60C8-65323D80-9-4D9F7D80.ics'
----

* *-F* has the same behavior as *-f* but it will first delete all contacts and events in database before restoring the backup.
So if an event/contact is not in the backup file, it will be lost. If a folder exists but is not in the backup file, nothing will happen
to it and its content.

*-F* expect a value that can be ALL to restore all folders, or the name of the folder to restore. You can list them with the *-l* mode.

Example:
----
sogo-tool restore -F ALL /tmp/backup user1
sogo-tool restore -F "Contacts/personal" tmp/backup user1
sogo-tool restore -F "Calendar/60C8-65323D80-7-4D9F7D80" tmp/backup user1
----

sogo-tool checkup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check the events and contacts data's integrity of a user

 sogo-tool checkup [-d] user...

* *-d*, optional, will delete all corrupted data.
* *user* is a single username or  multiple user each space-separated.

Will print out nothing if no corrupted data were found or one of the following messages:

* Corrupted calendar item (missing tags) in path <path> with c_name = <ics_id>
* Corrupted calendar item (unparsable) in path <path> with c_name = <ics_id>
* Missing start date of event in path <path> with c_name = <ics_id> (<event_name>)"
* Missing end date of event in path <path> with c_name = <ics_id> (<event_name>)"
* Start date (<start_date>) is not before end date (<end_date>) for event in path <path> with c_name = <ics_id> (<event_name>)
* Corrupted card item (unparsable) in path <path> with c_name = <vcard_id>

It can also print log from SOGo if it raise errors:

* <0x0x55e0956c4d00[VSCardSaxDriver]> serious inconsistency among begin/end tags

Example:
----
sogo-tool checkup user1
sogo-tool checkup -d user1
----

sogo-tool cleanup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Will purge all user's deleted events and contacts which the deletion is older than a number of days.

 sogo-tool cleanup [days] ALL|user1 [user2]

* *days* the age of deleted records to purge in days
* Second argument is *ALL* to purge events of all users or put each user space-separated.

Example:
----
sogo-tool cleanup 30 ALL
sogo-tool cleanup 30 user1 user2
----
Outputs:
----
Purged 3 records from folder /Users/user1/Calendar/60C7-65325300-9-18F39AA0
Purged 1 records from folder /Users/user1/Calendar/60C8-65323D80-7-4D9F7D80
Purged 0 records from folder /Users/user1/Calendar/personal
Purged 0 records from folder /Users/user1/Contacts/personal
Purged 5 records from folder /Users/user2/Calendar/personal
----


sogo-tool create-folder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a folder (Calendar or Address Book) for a user.

 create-folder user type [displayname ...]

* *user* is the name of the user
* *type* is either "Calendar" or "Contacts"
* *displayname* is the folder's name. If the name is already taken, a new folder will still be made but with another uid.

Example:
----
sogo-tool create-folder user1 Contacts Pro_Contacts Ext_Contacts
sogo-tool create-folder user2 Calendar Pro_Calendar
----


sogo-tool dump-defaults
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Output all current defaults value of GNUstep and SOGo (sogo.conf)

 sogo-tool dump-defaults [-f <filename>|[all]]

* Can be used without arguments and will output the defaults for gnustep domain 'sogod'.
* *all* option will output all defaults value found from sogo and gnustep in property list format.
* *-f* expect a filepath of an .xml file and will output it in property list format (sogo.conf). May need some tweaks, though.

Example:
----
sogo-tool dump-defaults
sogo-tool dump-defaults all
sogo-tool dump-defaults -f /tmp/foo/conf.xml
----

sogo-tool expire-sessions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Expires user sessions from database without activity for specified number of minutes. When a user log in to sogo for
the first time, sogo will create a entry in database's table OCSSessionsFolderURL with the user's information. Sogo will 
also set a cookie with an encoded value to fetch this database table. That way, each time the user make a request with that cookie,
sogo will know which connected user it is. This command will remove all user's session from database
without activity for specified number of minutes. Those users will have to log in again.

 sogo-tool expire-sessions [nbMinutes]

* *nbMinutes* Integer, number of minutes. All session without activity in these last minutes will be removed.

Example:
----
sogo-tool expire-sessions         #Will print usage.
sogo-tool expire-sessions 160     #Will remove session which last activity is older than 160 minutes.
sogo-tool expire-sessions 0       #Will remove session which last activity is older than 0 minutes.

 sogo-tool remove-doubles USER FOLDER

* *USER* is the name of the user to perform the removal
* *FOLDER* is the name of the folder to clean from duplicates

Two contacts are considered duplicates when they have the same mails or display name. When two or more contacts
are duplicates, each one will get a score. The ones with the highest score will be kept and the others
will be discarded. If two records have the same score, the first one to have reach it will be kept.
The scores are distributed as such:
* Record which has been the last modified: +1
* Record has the most content: +2
* Record has the most quick field set: +3
* Record is in a contact list: +6

Example:
----

* *fromuserid* Previous user id
* *touserid* New user id

If the new user id already exist, the command will output a message and do nothing.
**WARNING** This command only change database of sogo, if you use ldap or others databases they will still keep the old id.

Example:

 sogo-tool truncate-calendar [-r] USER FOLDER DATE

* *-r* optional, to also delete recurrent events that have occurrence after *DATE*
* *USER* is the name of the owner of the calendar
* *FOLDER* is the name of the calendar folder to clean up
* *DATE* UTC datetime, event older than this date will be removed

Without *-r*, only reccurrent events which all occurrences are older than *DATE* will be removed.
With *-r*, event the if there are occurrences after *DATE*, the recurrent event will be removed.
*DATE* can take the value `date +%FT%T` which is the current time

Example:
----
sogo-tool truncate-calendar sogo-tests1 personal 2023-10-25T00:00:00
sogo-tool truncate-calendar -r sogo-tests2 5E38-6538BE80-5-AFF8310 2022-01-01T15:30:00

----
Result:
----
No record to remove. All records kept.
----
----
Removing 1 records...
Removed 1 records.
----

sogo-tool update-autoreply
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

_This command is only useful if your sieve server doesn't have the capabilities *date* or *relational*_
In that case this command will check vacation's setting of all the users. If vacation is enabled/disabled,
the starting and ending date, the body and others parameters. If needed, the command
will write the sieve script accordingly. 

 sogo-tool update-autoreply -p credentialFile

* *-p- The credential file, a simple one-line file that contains "username:password" of an admin account of your imap/sieve server.

Example:
----
 sogo-tool update-autoreply -p /var/sogo/cred
----

sogo-tool user-preferences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Get, set or unset user defaults / settings in the database.

_Settings_ stores parameters for user's calendar, mail and contacts. It can be graphic
as month view or week view for calendar but it also stores subscription, delegation...
It also stores the private Salt for TOTP and the parameter ForceResetPassword to force the
user to change password.

_Defaults_ stores all parameters that can be found in Preferences panel. So it goes from default language to
autoreply to many others options.


 user-preferences get|set|unset defaults|settings user key [value|-f filename] [-p credentialFile]

* First argument is the action *get*, *set* or *unset*
* Second argument is parameter type *settings* or *defaults* 
* Third argument *user* is the name of the user where to make the action
* Fourth argument *key* is the name of the parameters where to make the action
* If the action is *set*, you should provide either *value* as fifth argument or a file with the value inside with *-f* filename/path
* If the action is *set* or *unset* and the *key* concerns a sieve script (filter, vacation, forward...), you
should provide a credential file, a one-line file that contains "username:password" of an admin account of your imap/sieve server.

As there is a lot of parameters, this documentation will not go into details for each one. To know what are 
the key names and their value you should got to your database in table defined by _SOGoProfileURL_ in your sogo.conf.
Here, for each row (user) you will find c_defaults and c_settings which are json with the keys. However, if
a parameter has never been set, it won't appears in those json. The clean way to know the missing keys is to
set it up in one of your dummy/dev/test account then see the values in _SOGoProfileURL_. Be careful, a value
can be a json itself, only the primary key can be get/set/unset.

Example with forwarding, *get* action:
----
sogo-tool user-preferences get defaults user1 Forward
----
If forward has never been set the result will be:
----
Value for key "Forward" not found in defaults 
----
Else it will be
----
{"forwardAddress":["sogo-tests2@sogo.alinto"],"enabled":1,"keepCopy":1}
----

*unset* action:
----
sogo-tool user-preferences unset defaults user1 Forward -p /etc/sogo/cred
----

*set* action:
----
sogo-tool user-preferences set defaults user1 Forward '{"forwardAddress":["sogo-tests2@sogo.alinto"],"enabled":1,"keepCopy":0}' -p cred
----
or create a json file which contains _{"forwardAddress":["sogo-tests2@sogo.alinto"],"enabled":1,"keepCopy":0}_ then:
----
sogo-tool user-preferences set defaults user1 Forward -f /path/filename -p cred
----



Upgrading
---------

This section describes what needs to be done when upgrading to the
current version of SOGo from the previous release.

[cols="100a"]
|=======================================================================

h|5.9.0
|Run the shell script `sql-update-5.8.4_to_5.9.0.sh` (if you are using MySQL). This will change the `c_defaults` to `MEDIUMTEXT`.

For mac Apple's Calendar users who re-create their calendar in 5.8.2, the account must be removed and re-added (https://bugs.sogo.nu/view.php?id=5639#c16901). This can be achived in  `ï£¿` / `System Settings` / `Internet Accounts`.

h|5.8.2
|Changes in Mac OS X Ventura 13.3. For mac Apple's Calendar users, the account must be removed and re-added (https://bugs.sogo.nu/view.php?id=5639#c16901). This can be achived in  `ï£¿` / `System Settings` / `Internet Accounts`.

h|5.8.1
|New options `SOGoSMTPMasterUserEnabled`, `SOGoSMTPMasterUserUsername` and `SOGoSMTPMasterUserPassword` has been added. Those parameters replace the `-p` option for sogo-ealarms-notify.

h|5.6.0
|The session table (`OCSSessionsFolderURL`) must be dropped prior to restart sogod.
This will allow users to use larger passwords (up to 2048 characters).

h|5.3.0
|A new private salt must be generated for users using TOTP. When TOTP is enabled for a user, it will
be disabled until the user configures it again, which will generate a new private salt.

h|5.1.0
|The XSRF protection is now enabled by default in SOGo. If you use the C.A.S.  mechanisim, you need
to disable XSRF by adding `SOGoXSRFValidationEnabled = NO` to your configuration file.

h|5.0.0
|Peer is now verified for TLS connections (SMTP/IMAP/Sieve). If you enabled
TLS on the local machine (localhost and similar), you need to disable peer
verification by adding `tlsVerifyMode=allowInsecureLocalhost` to the service URL.

h|4.1.0
|The default port for the SOGoSieveServer default is now 4190 (previously
2000). You need to explicitly set the port if you use a different port.

h|4.0.0
|Run the shell script `sql-update-3.2.10_to_4.0.0.sh` or
`sql-update-3.2.10_to_4.0.0-mysql.sh` (if you are using MySQL).

This will grow the "defaults" and "setting" fields of the SOGo user profile table
to a larger size. It will also add the required c_hascertificate column and add
the c_mail column to a large size contact's quick table.

h|2.3.1
|The SOGoCalendarDefaultCategoryColor default has been removed. If you
want to customize the color of calendar categories, use the
SOGoCalendarCategories and SOGoCalendarCategoriesColors defaults.

h|2.3.0
|Run the shell script `sql-update-2.2.17_to_2.3.0.sh` or
`sql-update-2.2.17_to_2.3.0-mysql.sh` (if you use MySQL).

This will grow the "participant states" field of calendar quick tables to a larger
size and add the the "c_description" column to calendar quick tables.

Moreover, if you are using a multi-domain configuration, make sure the keys for
your domains match the email domains you have defined.

h|2.2.8
|The configuration configuration parameters were renamed:

[options="compact"]
* _SOGoMailMessageCheck_ was replaced with _SOGoRefreshViewCheck_
* _SOGoMailPollingIntervals_ was replaced with _SOGoRefreshViewIntervals_

Backward compatibility is in place for the old preferences values.

h|2.0.5
|The configuration is now stored in /etc/sogo/sogo.conf. Perform the following commands as root to migrate your previous user defaults:

----
install -d -m 750 -o sogo -g sogo /etc/sogo
sudo -u sogo sogo-tool dump-defaults > /etc/sogo/sogo.conf
chown root:sogo /etc/sogo/sogo.conf
chmod 640 /etc/sogo/sogo.conf
sudo -u sogo mv ~/GNUstep/Defaults/.GNUstepDefaults \
    ~/GNUstep/Defaults/GNUstepDefaults.old
----

h|2.0.4
|The parameter _SOGoForceIMAPLoginWithEmail_ is now deprecated and is
replaced by _SOGoForceExternalLoginWithEmail_ (which extends the
functionality to SMTP authentication). Update your configuration if you
use this parameter.

The sogo user is now a system user. For new installs, this means that
`su - sogo` won't work anymore. Please use `sudo -u sogo <cmd>` instead.
If used in scripts from cronjobs, `requiretty` must be disabled in
sudoers.

h|1.3.17
|Run the shell script `sql-update-1.3.16_to_1.3.17.sh` or
`sql-update-1.3.16_to_1.3.17-mysql.sh` (if you use MySQL).

This will grow the "cycle info" field of calendar tables to a larger
size.

h|1.3.12
|Once you have updated and restarted SOGo, run the shell script
`sql-update-1.3.11_to_1.3.12.sh` or
`sql-update-1.3.11_to_1.3.12-mysql.sh` (if you use MySQL).

This will grow the "content" field of calendar and addressbook tables to
a larger size and fix the primary key of the session table.

h|1.3.9
|For Red Hat-based distributions, version 1.23 of GNUstep will be
installed. Since the location of the Web resources changes, the Apache
configuration file (`SOGo.conf`) has been adapted. Verify your Apache
configuration if you have customized this file.
