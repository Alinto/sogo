About this Guide
----------------

This guide will walk you through the installation and configuration of
popular SyncML clients to be used with the SOGo solution.

This guide also include instructions for configuring Apple iPhone OS
devices (iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad).

The instructions are based on version {release_version} of SOGo.

The latest version of this guide is available at
https://www.sogo.nu/support.html#/documentation.

Introduction
------------

SOGo is a free and modern scalable groupware server. It offers shared
calendars, address books, and emails through your favourite Web browser
and by using a native client such as Mozilla Thunderbird and Lightning.

SOGo is standard-compliant. It supports CalDAV, CardDAV, GroupDAV, iMIP
and iTIP and reuses existing IMAP, SMTP and database servers - making
the solution easy to deploy and interoperable with many applications.

SOGo features:

* Scalable architecture suitable for deployments from dozen to many
thousand users
* Rich Web-based interface that shares the look and feel, the features
and the data of Mozilla Thunderbird and Lightning
* Improved integration with Mozilla Thunderbird and Lighthing by using
the SOGo Connector and the SOGo Integrator
* Two-way synchronization support with any Microsoft ActiveSync-capable
device, or Outlook 2013

SOGo is developed by a community of developers located mainly in North
America and Europe. More information can be found on
http://www.sogo.nu/.

Installation
------------

This section will guide you through the installation of popular SyncML
clients on various devices.

Funambol SyncML Client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The recommended SyncML client for BlackBerry, Apple iPhone (for
contacts), mobile devices based on Microsoft Windows Mobile Smartphone
or Windows Mobile PocketPC, is the one provided directly by Funambol,
which is free and open source.

For Microsoft Window Mobile, you must identify which kind of device you
have ("Smartphone" vs. "PocketPC").

Once you've identified what kind of device you have, download the
appropriate client from:

http://www.funambol.com/opensource/downloads.php

The version 8.5 GA or later is required. 

NextHaus SyncJe
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For BlackBerry and Apple iPhone devices, you can also use the
SyncJe SyncML client from NextHaus (http://www.nexthaus.com/). This
client allows one to synchronize contacts, event and tasks with SOGo.

The version 2.43 or later is required. For BlackBerry 7XXX devices, the
required version is 2.25 but isn't officially supported. You can install
SyncJe on your BlackBerry device, over the air, by opening the following
link from your BlackBerry device:

http://www.nexthaus.com/bb/syncjebb.jad

This will download and install the application on your mobile device.
It's important to use the Web browser application and not the WAP
browser to perform this operation. Once installed, restart the device.
This procedure can also be used to update the SyncJe application. Note
that an update of SyncJe will not affect the state of previous
synchronizations. It's not necessary to perform a "slow sync" after an
update of SyncJe. 

Synthesis SyncML Client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Synthesis (http://www.synthesis.ch/) company provides a SyncML
client for Palm OS-based devices.

"Over The Air" synchronization is possible, as well as synchronization
through a cradle. For the latter, you must install Softick PPP using the
Palm Desktop software. The version 3.01 or later is required and you can
download it from http://www.softick.com/ppp/. Once installed, the
desktop computer must be restarted.

Once completed, you must download the Synthesis client for Palm OS. The
version 3.0.2.9 or later is required. Either the standard or the
professional version can be used.

Once downloaded, uncompress the archive and install the `.prc` file on
your Palm OS-based device. After, you should see a "SyncML" icon on your
device.

Configuration
-------------

In this section, you'll learn how to configure the popular SyncML
clients in order to fully synchronize your mobile device with SOGo.

Instructions for Apple iPhone OS based devices are also included. Note
that those devices do not require a SyncML client for synchronizing
calendars.

Funambol SyncML Client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the Funambol SyncML client is installed, start the application from
your mobile device to configure it using the following steps:

From the _Tools_ menu, choose _Options..._:

* Specify the _Location_. If your SOGo server is `sogo.domain.com`, the
location should be `http://sogo.domain.com/funambol/ds`.
* Specify your username and password
* Check the _Contacts_ check box and click on the _Details_ button.
  The synchronization type is _two-way_ and the _Remote name_ is
  `sogo-card`. The data format is vCard.
* Check the _Calendar_ check box and click on the _Details_ button. The
  synchronization type is _two-way_ and the _Remote name_ is `sogo-cal`.
  The data format is vCalendar.
* Check the _Tasks_ check box and click on the _Details_ button. The
  synchronization type is _two-way_ and the _Remote name_ is
  `sogo-todo`. The data format is SIF.
* Save the preferences.

To prevent the BlackBerry to automatically add a new event in the
calendar when an invitation is received by email (IMIP message) on the
BlackBerry device, you should delete the CICAL service from the Service
Book. To do so, proceed with the following steps:

From the _Options_ menu:

* Choose _Advanced Options_
* Choose _Service Book_
* Identify the line that mentions the email address of the BlackBerry
  user followed by the `[CICAL]` string. For example, `user@domain.com
[CICAL]`.
* Delete this entry.

Once completed, you must restart the device by removing its battery for
a couple of seconds. If you ever want to reactivate the CICAL service,
follow those instructions:

http://support.appriver.com/KB/a205/how-to-resend-service-books-on-blackberry.aspx

Once complete, the client is ready for an initial synchronization.

Ideally, you should *delete* all data from the mobile device before the
initial synchronization. To do so:

* From the _Tools_ menu, choose _Recover..._
* Choose _Replace with data from server_
* Check the _Contacts_, _Calendar_ and _Tasks_ check boxes

Finally, click on the _Sync All_ button to proceed with the
synchronization.

NextHaus SyncJe
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once NextHaus SyncJe is installed, proceed with the following steps,
from your BlackBerry device, to configure it:

* Open the _SyncJe Client_

From the _Settings_ menu:

* Specify the _Server URL_. If your SOGo server is `sogo.domain.com`,
the URL should be `http://sogo.domain.com/funambol/ds`.
* Specify your user name and password
* Check the _Contacts_ check box and specify `sogo-card` as the
  _Foldername_
* Check the _Calendar_ check box and specify `sogo-cal` as the
  _Foldername_
* Check the _ToDo_ check box and specify `sogo-todo` as the _Foldername_
* Check the _Auto Sync_ check box if you wish to automatically
  synchronize contacts, events and tasks at a predefined time interval
* Do *not* check the _Sync events between_ check box
* Check the _Skip saving attendees_ - this will prevent the BlackBerry
  device from sending emails to meeting participants for events
  downloaded from the SOGo server
* Check the _BIS_ check box (for _BlackBerry Internet Services_)
* Leave the other fields to the their default value
* Then choose _Save_ from the menu to save the preferences 

To prevent the BlackBerry to automatically add a new event in the
calendar when an invitation is received by email (IMIP message) on the
BlackBerry device, you should delete the CICAL service from the Service
Book. To do so, proceed with the following steps:

From the _Options_ menu:

* Choose _Advanced Options_
* Choose _Service Book_
* Identify the line that mentions the email address of the BlackBerry
user followed by the `[CICAL]` string. For example, `user@domain.com
[CICAL]`.
* Delete this entry

Once completed, you must restart the device by removing its battery for
a couple of seconds. If you ever want to reactivate the CICAL service,
follow those instructions:

http://support.appriver.com/KB/a205/how-to-resend-service-books-on-blackberry.aspx

Once done, you're now ready for your first synchronization.

Ideally, you must delete all data on the BlackBerry before proceeding
with the initial synchronization. To do so, proceed with the following
steps:

* Open the _SyncJe Client_

From the _Settings_ menu:

* Choose the _Clear databases_ option
* Respond _Yes_ to all questions. This will delete all contacts, events
  and tasks from your BlackBerry device. 
* Go back in the previous menu
* Choose the _Force Slow Sync_ option
* Choose the _Start Sync_ option to start the synchronization. This
  could take a few minutes if you have many contacts, events or tasks.
  Subsequent synchronizations should be much faster. 

After the initial _Slow Sync_, you can simply chose the _Start Sync_ 
option if you do a manual synchronization to synchronize all changes. 

Synthesis SyncML Client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the Synthesis SyncML client is installed, proceed with the
following steps to configure it:

* Open the _Synthesis SyncML Standard Edition_ application

From the _Settings..._ menu:

* Specify the _Server URL_. If your SOGo server is `sogo.domain.com`,
  the URL should be `http://sogo.domain.com/funambol/ds`.
* Specify your user name and password
* Check the _Contacts_, _Events_ and _Task_ check boxes
* Click on the _more..._ button
* For the _Contacts_, choose _reload device_ and specify `sogo-card` as
  the _Server Path_.
* For the _Events_, choose _reload device_ and specify `sogo-cal` as
  the _Server Path_. Do *not* check the _Only from..._ check box.
* For the _Tasks_, choose _reload device_ and specify `sogo-todo` as
  the _Server Path_.
* Once completed, click on the _Done_ button

The _reload device_ value will *delete* all entries on the device during
the initial synchronization and obtain contacts, events and tasks from
the server. If you do not want to delete everything from the device,
please choose _normal_ instead of _reload device_.

Once ready, click on the _Start_ button to proceed with the initial
synchronization.

During the initial synchronization, the Palm device will ask you how to
connect to the desktop system. From the Palm device, choose _Windows
RAS_ without specifying an user name or a password. This will allow the
Palm device to establish a PPP connection between itself and Softick PPP
and then communicate using its TCP/IP stack to the Funambol server.

Apple iOS — Calendars
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting from iOS 3, Apple has added CalDAV support to the calendar
application included in the iPhone/iPod/iPad.

To add a CalDAV account, follow those instructions:

* From the _Settings_ menu, choose _Mail, Contacts, Calendars_
* Choose _Add Account..._
* Choose _Other_
* Choose _Add CalDAV Account_
* Specify the _Server_, the URL should be
  `http://sogo.domain.com/SOGo/dav/<username>`

On iOS 3.1.2 and later, you must also specify the range of events you
want to have. 

* From the _Settings_ menu, choose _Mail, Contacts, Calendars_
* From the _Sync_ menu, choose _All Events_

Note that other options (_Events 2 Weeks Back_, etc.) do not work right
now.

Apple iOS — Contacts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to synchronize contacts with your Apple mobile device, use
the native address book application with SOGo using the CardDAV
protocol. To configure the address book application so it works with
SOGo, create a new CardDAV account and specify your server name. In
the _Advanced Settings_, set the port to `8800`.

On iOS prior to version 4, you must install the Funambol client and
configure the `sogo-card` source.
