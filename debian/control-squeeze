Description: a modern and scalable groupware
 SOGo is a groupware server built around OpenGroupware.org (OGo) and

 The Inverse edition of this project has many feature enhancements:
  * CalDAV and GroupDAV compliance
  * full handling of vCard as well as vCalendar/iCalendar formats
  * support for folder sharing and ACLs
 .
 The Web interface has been rewritten in an AJAX fashion to provide a faster
 UI for the users, consistency in look and feel with the Mozilla applications,
 and to reduce the load of the transactions on the server.
