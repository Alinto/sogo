	requested (initMailboxSelection), the dtree is expanded throughout
	the mailbox entry's parent hierarchy to ensure it is made visible
	when the page is being displayed. (new function: expandUpperTree).
	- mailbox loading: when loading a mailbox where a message was
	previously selected, we invoke its url with the "pageforuid"
	parameter correctly specified. During callback processing, we scan
	the table for the related row and reselect it.
	Also, the message area is set blank before loading any mailbox.

	* UI/MailerUI/UIxMailListView.m ([UIxMailListView
	-defaultAction]): if the "pageforuid" parameter is passed in the

	which returns the nodes for the parent specified in "parentMenu".
	Used to generate the javascript code for the folder dtree.

	* UI/Templates/MailerUI/UIxMailPanelFrame.wox: the components
	using that container-template are now using UIxMailMainFrame
	since UIxMailPanelFrame had no real interest. File removed.

	* UI/WebServerResources/dtree.{css,js}: new files to handle
	javascript-generated mailbox tree. Modified from original version
	by integrating the previous code with the one we are using for
	selections and mailbox handling. Minor visual enhancements too...

2006-07-25  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* SoObjects/Mailer/SOGoUser+Mail.m: if only one identity is to be

	the new "menu" DIV class (popup menus).

	* UI/WebServerResources/generic.js: added "sanitizeMailTo" which
	takes any chunk of text as param, detects the user email and the
	optional first and last names and return them in a well-formatted
	way. Renamed "getSelection" to "getSelectedNodes" to avoid a
	namespace conflict. Added "onMenuClick(node, event, menuId)" to
	handle popup menus through "onclick" element attributes (node =
	this, event = event and menuId = name of the menu DIV id to
	popup).

	* UI/Contacts/UIxContactEditorBase.m ([UIxContactEditorBase
	-snapshot]): add an entry for "email" into the snapshot
	dictionary if a "contactEmail" URL parameter was detected and if
	the entry for "email" is empty.

	* UI/Contacts/Toolbars/SOGoContactFolder.toolbar: the "new card"
	button now invokes the newContact() js function in ContactsUI.js
	instead of opening "new" directly. newContact() pops up a window
	stripped from its navigation bar.

	* UI/Contacts/ContactsUI.js: new module specific to the ContactsUI
	bundle (AddressBook).

	* UI/Templates/MailerUI/UIxMailView.wox: added a div of class

	replaced the body tables with a div of class "pageContent"
	(standardization across the page templates).

	* UI/Templates/MailerUI/UIxMailMainFrame.wox: include
	productJavaScriptURL and pageJavaScriptURL (conditionnally) since
	those are now inherited from UIxPageFrame.

	* UI/MailerUI/UIxMailView.js: new file specific to UIxMailView.

	* UI/MailerUI/UIxMailToSelection.m ([UIxMailToSelection -to]): if
	a "mailto" URL parameter is detected and the "to" array is empty,
	initialize "to" with the value of "mailto" before returning it.

	* UI/MailerUI/UIxMailEditorAction.m ([UIxMailEditorAction
	-composeAction]): rewrote method in a cleaner way and with usage
	of the URL extensions to NSString and NSDictionary (see below).
	Also, if a "mailto" url parameter is detected, pass it to the
	redirected url.

	* UI/MailerUI/UIxMailMainFrame.m: subclassed from UIxPageFrame to
	reduce code.

	* UI/Common/NSDictionary+URL.m ([NSDictionary -asURLParameters]):
