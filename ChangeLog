	Merge back lost code to handle encoding of binary and rcf822 attachments.

2012-05-15  Jean Raby  <jraby@inverse.ca>

	* SoObjects/Appointments/SOGoAppointmentObject.m (_handleResourcesConflicts):
	Deny access to resources if the resource's ACL don't allow the organizer
	to read its freebusy info.
	Without this, sogo would always auto-accept invitations from 'unprivileged'
	users, potentially bypassing the multiplebooking parameter.
	
2012-05-14  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* UI/WebServerResources/UIxContactsUserFolders.js: folder ids are
	in the form "user:module/folder", therefore we must remove the
	first char, which is a slash.

	* UI/WebServerResources/generic.js (subscribeToFolder): prepend a
	"/" to the folder name, as it comes originally in the form
	user:module/folder.

	* UI/WebServerResources/UIxPreferences.js (initMailAccounts)
	(displayMailAccount): getElementsByTagName seems too standard for
	IE, we use $$() now so that we can invoke "each" on the result set
	without triggering an exception.

2012-05-09  Jean Raby  <jraby@inverse.ca>

	* SoObjects/Appointments/SOGoAppointmentObject.m (PUTAction):
	Delete bitrotten code that could end up duplicating attendees.
	Behavior exposed by the new caldav tests

	* Tests/Integration/config.py.in
	* Tests/Integration/test-caldav-scheduling.py
	* Tests/Integration/test-ical.py
	* Tests/Integration/test-davacl.py:
	Use an unprivileged webdavclient where possible.
	This would have uncovered the resources calendar autocreation bug.

	* Tests/Integration/test-caldav-scheduling.py:
	New tests to excercise somewhat fragile code in dav autoscheduling.

2012-05-09  Jean Raby  <jraby@inverse.ca>

	* SoObject/SOGo/SOGoParentFolder.m (_createPersonalFolder):
	Automatically create the folder if its owner is a resource.
	(not if the active user is a resource)

2012-05-09  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* SoObjects/Mailer/SOGoDraftObject.m - don't encode message/rfc822
	parts in base64 - it's not allowed.

2012-05-08  Francis Lachapelle  <flachapelle@inverse.ca>

	* UI/WebServerResources/ContactsUI.js (configureDraggables)
	(configureDroppables, startDragging, whileDragging, stopDragging)

	(configureDroppables, startDragging, whileDragging, stopDragging)
	(dropAction): idem.

2012-05-01  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* UI/WebServerResources/generic.js (accessToSubscribedFolder): use
	the last part of the string as folder identifier. Otherwise we end
	up with the module name.

	* SoObjects/Mailer/SOGoDraftObject.m
	(-bodyPartForAttachmentWithName:): attach rfc822 content as
	with base64 encoding, just as any other non-text data.

2012-04-30  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoDomainDefaults.{h,m} - added
	-hideSystemEMail that honors SOGoHideSystemEMail.
	Right now, this variable is limited only to
	the calendar-user-address-set response but can/will be
	extended later.

	* SoObjects/Appointments/SOGoUserFolder+Appointments.m
	(-davCalendarUserAddressSet): Modified to honor
	SOGoHideSystemEMail domain default.

	* SoObjects/Mailer/SOGoDraftObject.m (-lookupName:...):
	We prioritize the lookup of the "Drafts" folder over the
	"Sent" one if both are matching.

	* SoObjects/Mailer/SOGoDraftObject.m
	(-updateFromLDIFRecord:): carry the c_info attribute
	in vcards through the x-sogo-contactinfo attribute.
	This functionality was lost a while ago.
	We used to use the NOTE attribute for this. From now on,
	the sogo-connector.autoComplete.commentAttribute have to be set to
	'unprocessed:x-sogo-contactinfo' instead of 'Notes'.


2012-04-25  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	custom identity even though only the full name has a custom value.

	* SoObjects/Mailer/SOGoDraftObject.m
	(-bodyPartForAttachmentWithName:): force conversion of rfc822
	content to quoted-printable, since it would otherwise risk passing
	8bit data via the "APPEND" command.

2012-04-24  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* UI/WebServerResources/SchedulerUI.js (updateCalendarStatus): if
	"event" is set, we set its returnValue to true, to avoid a bug
	occurring since the use of "clickEventWrapper".
	(resizeCalendarHeaderDIV): new function that resizes the all-day
	event containers progressively.
	(_drawCalendarAllDayEvents, _deleteCalendarEventBlocks): invoke
	the above.

	all callers to reflect that change.

	* SoObjects/Appointments/SOGoAppointmentObject.m (-PUTAction:)
	Took some of the logic from SOGoContentObject's -PUTAction: to
	avoid etag mismatches.

2012-04-23  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

    * SoObjects/Appointments/SOGoAppointmentObject.m: We now
	automatically add/remove attendees to recurrence exceptions
	when they are being added to the master event. Also
	fixed -PUTAction: so that we fetch the organizer of a recurrence
	exception when the master doesn't have a copy of it.

	* SoObjects/Appointments/SOGoAppointmentOccurence.m: added
	-componentTag to avoid server crash.

2012-04-20  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	account only when SOGoMailCustomFromEnabled is NO.

	* UI/PreferencesUI/UIxPreferences.m (_extractMainIdentity:): the
	custom values for "fullName" and "email" are now registered in the
	user defaults, if "email" is different from all the values
	returned by the user directory AND if SOGoMailCustomFromEnabled is
	YES.

	the value of "SOGoMailReplyTo" in the "replyTo" field of each

	a value for "SOGoMailCustomEmail", a first identity is created and
	set at the first position in the list, based on that value and on
	"SOGoMailCustomFullName".

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoUserDefaults.m (-setMailReplyTo:)
	(-mailReplyTo:): accessors for the "SOGoMailReplyTo" user default.

	* OpenChange/MAPIStoreFolder.m
	(_modifyPermissionEntryForUser:withRoles:isAddition:withACLFolder:):

	modification.

2012-03-12  Francis Lachapelle  <flachapelle@inverse.ca>

	* SoObjects/SOGo/WORequest+SOGo.m (-isIPhoneAddressBookApp): catch
	the user agent of iOS 5.0.1 on iPad.

2012-03-12  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* OpenChange/MAPIStoreGCSFolder.m (-lastMessageModificationTime):
	force a synchronisation from here to ensure that the cache is
	up-to-date.

	* OpenChange/MAPIStoreTypes.m (_reverseCN): fixed used of ull
	constants on 32 bit platforms.

	* OpenChange/MAPIStoreGCSFolder.m (-componentQualifier): now
	provided by the parent class itself.
	(-contentComponentQualifier): new method that returns a qualifier
	that translated to "c_content like '%BEGIN:XXX%'". This is a hack
	to work-around the fact that calendar folders may content both
	vevent and vtodo and that c_component, being part of the quick
	table, is no longer available when a record is deleted.
	(-synchroniseCache): update version values for deleted records
	too, by taking into account the fact that their c_version value
	might still be 0. Make use of contentComponentQualifier above.
	Remove the modified records from the SOGoGCSFolder cache.
	(-getDeletedKeysFromChangeNumber:andCN:inTableType:): wander the
	list of deleted records and no longer increase the change number,
	as this is now done from "synchroniseCache". Also, handle the case
	were deleted records might already have been reported by comparing
	their change number to the one provided as parameter. The
	resulting change number is now guaranteed to be the highest one.
	(-component): new subclassable method that returns a string
	matching the folder's handled component.

	* OpenChange/MAPIStoreFolder.m
	(-getPidTagLocalCommitTimeMax:inMemCtx:): returns
	MAPISTORE_ERR_NOT_FOUND if the resulting date is nil.

	* OpenChange/MAPIStoreGCSMessage.m
	(-getPidTagPredecessorChangeList:inMemCtx:): when the list is
	missing, request a synchronisation from the container as the
	message might now have been synchronised yet...

	* OpenChange/MAPIStoreTypes.m (MAPICNCompare): new function that
	returns an NSComparisonResult for two change numbers (reverse
	format).

2012-03-11  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	(-getPidLidAppointmentMessageClass:inMemCtx:): returns "IPM.Appointment".
	(-getPidLidSideEffects:inMemCtx:): returns the value specified in
	OXOCAL, section 2.2.2.2.
	(_fixupAppointmentObjectWithUID:): renamed method and made more
	generic, in order to handle the case where the response record has
	already been deleted.
	(-save): handle organizer and attendees more in compliance with
	the spec, in order to avoid ending up with an empty event when an
	invitation is being replied to. Of course, the documentation
	happened to be inexact with regardes to the value of
	"PidTagRecipientTrackStatus", which can be 5 even though the user
	replied with another value... Also, lowered the priority of
	SOGo-specific hacks for setting the organizer.

2012-03-09  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* OpenChange/MAPIStoreMailVolatileMessage.m (-submitWithFlags:):
	skip any message that is not of class "IPM.Note", in order to
	avoid sending invitations or responses.

	* SoObjects/Mailer/SOGoMailFolder.m (-renameTo:): reset the
	imap4URL to nil and change the nameInContainer after a successful
	operation.

	* OpenChange/MAPIStoreFolder.m
	(-getTable:andRowCount:tableType:andHandleId:): if the current
	user is not the owner of the folder, the permissions table cannot
	be open and MAPISTORE_ERR_DENIED is now returned.

	* SoObjects/Contacts/NGVCard+SOGo.m
	(_setupEmailFieldsInLDIFRecord:): the value of card elements were
	not properly extracted when no email field were of type "home" or
	"work".

2012-03-08  Francis Lachapelle  <flachapelle@inverse.ca>

	* UI/WebServerResources/generic.js (getTopWindow): extend the
	attributes of document.body before calling "hasClassName" to fix
	an error with IE9.

2012-03-08  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* OpenChange/MAPIStoreFolder.m: commented out key cache ivars
	(temporarily).

	* OpenChange/MAPIStoreContext.m (-getRootFolder:inMemCtx:): do not
	store the looked up folders when they are not descendants of
	SOGoObject. Return MAPISTORE_ERR_NOT_FOUND when the looked up
	folder is owner by the current user and MAPISTORE_ERR_DENIED
	otherwise.

	* OpenChange/MAPIStoreGCSFolder.m (-synchroniseCache): ensure that
	any record that are marked as updated are removed from the record
	cache of the corresponding SOGoGCSFolder instance.

	* OpenChange/MAPIStoreFolder.m (-getPidTagSubFolders:inMemCtx:):
	invoke [self folderKeys] rather than the corresponding ivar.

	where the home mail would be taken for both first and second email
	fields when no work mail was present.

	(-moveCopyMessagesWithMIDs:andCount:fromFolder:withMIDs:andChangeKeys:wantCopy:):
	we sync the version cache with the folder in order to update the

	creation of a folder fails in the proper contact, fallback on the
	fallback context.

	* SoObjects/Mailer/SOGoMailAccount.m
	(-toManyRelationshipKeysWithNamespaces:): for some reason, we were
	explicitly returning the drafts folder name in the batch whether
	the corresponding folder exists or not, which is useless and
	wrong since the folder in question might actually be a child of
	another folder.

	* OpenChange/MAPIStoreContext.m (-init): restored "containersBag"
	mechanism where root context folders that are deeper than the
	first level of their hierarchy needs to have their parent folders

	* OpenChange/MAPIStoreSOGo.m (sogo_message_modify_recipients):

	as in MAPIStoreGCSMessage's version.

	* OpenChange/MAPIStoreMailFolder.m (-messageTable): we no longer

	* SoObjects/Mailer/SOGoMailFolder.m

	when a contextual menu is hidden.

	* UI/WebServerResources/MailerUI.js (onFolderMenuClick):

	Fixed exclusion of records ending with "Error" and "Unicode".
	Also, we now exclude PidTag properties with a value > 0x80000000
	since they may overlap with named properties.
	(__main__): replace multi-string with multi-unicode identifiers
	too.
	(__main__): we output getter indexes as 16 bit hex values, for

	workaround for a libxml's issue where the charset
	specified in meta tags have precedence over the one
	we "force" when creating the parser. This "bug" has
	just been fixed in libxml but it'll take years before
	all distributions get that fix. For now, we strip
	that tag, unconditionnaly.

2011-05-10  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	select the personal calendar to avoid trying creating an event or
	a task in the calendar to which the user has just unsubscribed.

2011-04-25  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* Added the concept of "resources" in SOGo in order
	to avoid double-bookings (if not more) and also, handle

	argument can now be a string or an element.
	(isWebKit): was isSafari; now consider all WebKit-based browsers together.

	* UI/WebServerResources/UIxMailToSelection.js: various
	improvements to behave like in Thunderbird.

	* UI/WebServerResources/SOGoAutoCompletion.js: idem.

	* UI/WebServerResources/UIxMailEditor.js (initAddresses): was

	subclasses were using the same MAPIStoreAttachmentTable
	implementation, this method now performs the same operation and
	thereby no longer requires subclasssing.

	the method selector and pass it as argument to the IMP of the
	property getter, as would be with any regular method invocation.

	* OpenChange/MAPIStoreMailMessage.m (-getPrBody:): no longer check
	the size of the returned content, as streams are now handled
	internally by OpenChange.
	(-getPrHtml): same as above.

	helper function as it's no longer used.

	* OpenChange/MAPIStoreSOGo.m (sogo_op_set_property_from_fd)

	longer used, as OpenChange handles the property streams internally
	now.

	MAPIStoreSupportedProperties as the array of properties that are
	handled by OpenChange and MAPIStoreSupportedPropertiesCount as the
	count of those properties.

	corollary of the "sogo_pocop_get_available_properties" backend
	method.
	(-getAvailableProperties): proxy to the class method of the same

	longer a mandatory method, returns [self childKeys] when not
	overriden and issue an error message.

	* OpenChange/MAPIStoreFolder.m (-createMessage): no longer a
	mandatory method. Returns nil when not overriden.

	date by looking at the occurrence interval.
	(-importCalendar:): added a duration to events with no end date nor duration.

	* SoObjects/Appointments/SOGoAppointmentObject.m
	(-_adjustEventsInRequest:): new method to verify the vCalendar for
	any inconsistency or missing attributes. Currently, it only adds a
	duration if no end date nor duration is found.

	* UI/WebServerResources/ckeditor/config.js: Changed the default
	enter mode to use BR instead of P. This matches the behavior of Thunderbird.

2011-04-14  Francis Lachapelle  <flachapelle@inverse.ca>

	* UI/WebServerResources/UIxContactEditor.js
	(validateContactEditor): now uses the regexp defined in generic.js

	submitted recipients and subjects (URL-encoded).

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoUserManager.m (-getImapLoginForUID:): we now

	authenticationFilter is defined, we add it to the SQL where clause.
	(_lookupContactEntry:considerEmail:): we add a new key
	 (canAuthenticate) to the returned dictionary that specifies if the
	user can authenticate or not. We also add c_imaplogin when the
	user must authenticate with a different username to the IMAP server.

	returns true if the user can authenticate, based on the
	authentication filter associated to the source.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoGCSFolder.m (-ocsFolder): don't automatically
	create the folder if the user can't authenticate.

	* UI/Contacts/UIxContactsListActions.m: was
	UIxContactsListView.m. The new method contactsListAction now
	returns a JSON representation of the addressbook.

	* UI/Contacts/UIxContactFoldersView.m (-personalContactInfos): new
	method used to populate the wox template with the personal
	addressbook. The addressbook module is now pre-loaded with it,
	eliminating an Ajax query.

	* UI/WebServerResources/ContactsUI.js (initContacts): delegate
	all events to the table instead of each row.
	(contactsListCallback): we now receive a JSON representation of
	the contacts and reuse the existing table rows instead of
	overwriting the table.

2011-04-13  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* OpenChange/MAPIStoreObject.m: make use of the IMP cache methods
	available in MAPIStorePropertySelectors to query object
	properties.

2011-04-05  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* OpenChange/MAPIStoreCalendarMessage.m (-getProperty:withTag):

	* Tests/Integration/all.py: (from Jean Raby) make use of the
	"SOGoLanguage" defaults key rather than the old "Language" one.

	based on SOGoObject instances.

	* OpenChange/MAPIStoreRecurrenceUtils.m: new module implementing
	methods useful for handling recurrences in events and tasks.

2011-03-31  Francis Lachapelle  <flachapelle@inverse.ca>

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoBuild.m: export new SOGoVersion NSString.

	* Main/SOGo.m (+initialize): moved most initialization code from
	-init and -run here since this method is invoked before forking

	memory usage of combined SOGo processes.
	(+applicationWillStart): new method replacing +initialize.

2011-03-30  Francis Lachapelle  <flachapelle@inverse.ca>

	* SoObjects/Appointments/SOGoAppointmentFolder.m
	(-fetchFreeBusyInfosFrom:to:): we must fetch the c_content in

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoSystemDefaults.m (-pageTitle): new method to
	retrieve the Web page title from the new system defaults "SOGoPageTitle".

	* SoObjects/Appointments/SOGoAppointmentObject.m (-PUTAction:):

	the organizer of an exception to a recurrence and
	we were also incorrectly always updating the master
	event with the part-state.

2011-03-23  Francis Lachapelle  <flachapelle@inverse.ca>

	* UI/PreferencesUI/UIxPreferences.m (-timeZonesList): we make use
	of the new method [iCalTimeZone knownTimeZoneNames] instead of
	[NSTimeZone knownTimeZoneNames] to avoid listing tons of useless timezones.

	* UI/PreferencesUI/UIxPreferences.m (-userTimeZone): since we now
	offer a limited number of timezones, the user timezone could be
	unrecognized. In this case, try to find a timezone with the same

	PidLidIsRecurring), returns YES when recurring.
	(PidLidAppointmentRecur) property handles property, by using
	-_computeAppointmentRecur and other submethods.

	* OpenChange/NSCalendarDate+MAPIStore.m (-asMinutesSince1601):
	corollary to +dateFromMinutesSince1601.

2011-03-21  Francis Lachapelle  <flachapelle@inverse.ca>

	* Tools/SOGoToolBackup.m (-fetchUserIDs:): when choosing to backup

	of results.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/LDAPSource.m (:_qualifierForFilter): avoid
	duplicated filters on the CN attribute.

	* UI/WebServerResources/UIxPreferences.js

	(+dateFromMinutesSince1601): new constructor, helpful for MAPI
	recurrence structures.

	* OpenChange/MAPIStoreCalendarMessageTable.m,
	OpenChange/MAPIStoreTasksMessageTable.m,
	OpenChange/MAPIStoreContactsMessageTable.m,
	OpenChange/MAPIStoreMailMessageTable.m,

	avoid crashes when alarm data is not properly entered.

2011-03-18  Francis Lachapelle  <flachapelle@inverse.ca>

	set "showCompletedTasks" earlier in order to properly fetch the
	tasks upon the first refresh.

	* UI/Scheduler/UIxAppointmentEditor.m

	vTimeZone to start/end dates of an all-day vEvent.

	* UI/Scheduler/UIxCalListingActions.m
	(-_fetchFields:forComponentOfType:): we don't add components
	outside the covered period. This could happen with all-day events,
	since their dates are always GMT.

	* SoObjects/Appointments/iCalEvent+SOGo.m (-quickRecord): an all-day
	event usually doesn't have a timezone. However, if it does, we must
	convert its dates to GMT. All-day events are "floating", in the
	sense that they are timezone-independant.

2011-03-17  Francis Lachapelle  <flachapelle@inverse.ca>

	* UI/MailerUI/UIxMailAccountActions.m (-listMailboxesAction):
	moved code that fetches the inbox quota to [SOGoMailAccount getInboxQuota].

	* SoObjects/Mailer/SOGoMailAccount.m (-getInboxQuota): new method
	created partially from the method [UIxMailAccountActions listMailboxesAction].

	extracted from updateMailboxTreeInPage. It is called when a folder
	operation returns the inbox quota.

2011-03-15  Francis Lachapelle  <flachapelle@inverse.ca>

	* UI/MailerUI/UIxMailListActions.m (-getMailAction): removed this
	method that is no longer used since live-loading.

	expunged when switching folder.

2011-03-11  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* SoObjects/Contacts/SOGoContactFolders.m
	(-setDavContactsCategories:): we need to handle the case where the
	"category" element has more than one subnode, in particular when
	xml entities are used.

2011-03-11  Francis Lachapelle  <flachapelle@inverse.ca>

	* UI/WebServerResources/HTMLElement.js (onContextMenu): hide the
	menu on a mousedown, not a click. This fixes a problem on Webkit browsers.

	* UI/WebServerResources/generic.js: cleanup some event observers
	related to contextual menus.

	* UI/WebServerResources/UIxMailEditor.js (initMailEditor): added
	the SpellChecker button in the HTML editor toolbar, and disabled
	the "check while typing" option (scayt).

	* UI/WebServerResources/ContactsUI.js (initContacts): don't define
	the categories contextual menu if the contacts list doesn't
	exist. This fixes a problem when adding categories to a contact
	using IE7.

2011-03-10  Francis Lachapelle  <flachapelle@inverse.ca>

	* SoObjects/Appointments/SOGoAppointmentFolder.m (-fixupRecord):

	the input category field doesn't appear if the card is
	read-only. Adjusted the code accordingly.

	* UI/WebServerResources/ContactsUI.js
	(onCategoriesMenuItemCallback): new callback that refreshes the
	displayed card when a category is added or removed.

2011-03-10  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* UI/WebServerResources/ContactsUI.js (onCategoriesMenuItemClick):
	makes use of "encodeURIComponent" rather than "escape" to encode
	URL parameters, because for some reason the former takes the
	encoding into account and not the latter.

2011-03-08  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* OpenChange/MAPIStoreCalendarMessage.m (-save): accept entries
	with an "x500dn" record since they are now properly converted.

	properly find out the coordinates of internal users.

2011-03-07  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* OpenChange/MAPIStore*Context.m (+registerFixedMappings): removed
	method, made obsolete by the fact that we now receive the context
	fid during initialization.

	* OpenChange/MAPIStoreFAIMessageTable.[hm]: restored class module
	in order to reenable proper class testing during notifications.

	* OpenChange/MAPIStoreTypes.h (MAPIPropertyKey): we now make use

	(sogo_pocop_set_table_restrictions)
	(sogo_pocop_set_table_sort_order): new poc methods.

	(-unregisterObjectWithName:inContainer:): same as below.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoGCSFolder.m (-removeChildRecordWithName:):
	new method to ensure a child records is removed from the cache
	when modified or deleted.

2011-03-04  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* SoObjects/Appointments/SOGoAppointmentFolder.h/m:
	-importCalendar: we now also import the timezone definition
	when present
	* SoObjects/SOGo/SQLSource.m
	We now consider the domain belonging to the SQLSource instance

2011-02-25  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* OpenChange/MAPIStoreMailContext.[hm]: renamed from
	MAPIStoreMailBaseContext and merged in all subclass modules due to
	their small size.

	been moved to the MAPIStoreMessage classes.

	* OpenChange/SOGoMAPIFSMessage.m (-appendProperties:): new name
	for "setMAPIProperties:"
	(-save): new name for "MAPISave", since those were methods
	ususally found in the obsolete category modules.

	* OpenChange/MAPIStoreSOGo.m:
	(sogo_pocop_get_attachment_table, sogo_pocop_get_attachment)
	(sogo_pocop_create_attachment, sogo_pocop_set_table_columns)

	(sogo_pocop_set_properties, sogo_pocop_release): new backend
	methods (with counterparts in SOGoContext) that are used as part
	of the new proof-of-concept API, where objects are accessed
	directly from memory instead of needed to be resolved via their
	fid, mid or aid identifiers.

	* OpenChange/MAPIStoreAttachment.m: new super class, derived from
	MAPIStoreObject and used for MAPI attachment objects.

	* OpenChange/MAPIStoreFolder.m: new super class used as wrapper

	content key facilities.

	* OpenChange/MAPIStoreMessage.m: new super class used for
	wrapper objects replacing the category modules on the SOGoObject.

	the SQL-based authentication sources (required database columns)
	and also the "id" uniqueness of authentication sources in general

	timezone. This fixes an issue when accessing occurrences of a
	recurrent event.

2011-02-22  Francis Lachapelle  <flachapelle@inverse.ca>

	* UI/Scheduler/UIxCalListingActions.m (
	-_fillBlocks:withEvent:withNumber:): don't compute the block if
	the end date is before the start date. This fixes a rare segfault that
	occurs with recurrent event with multiple exceptions.

2011-02-17  Francis Lachapelle  <flachapelle@inverse.ca>

	* SoObjects/Contacts/SOGoFolder+CardDAV.m (-parseContactFilter:):

	subclassed from MAPIStoreFSMessageTable, that provides the
	interface for FAI messages in MAPIStoreContext.

	debugging.
	(sogo_op_createmessage): takes a new "associated" flag parameter.

	* OpenChange/MAPIStoreContext.m: refactored to extract the table
	handling code into a separate class. This enables the introduction
	of real classes for contents tables, folder tables and FAI tables,
	as well as any other type that could be handled later. Changes:
	- new messageTableClass and folderTableClass methods for
	determining the class that is appropriate to the current datatype.
	- new messageTable, folderTable ivars.
	- new faiTable ivar, always an instance of
	MAPIStoreFAIMessageTable.
	- created MAPIStoreTable, subclassed into MAPIStoreMessageTable
	and MAPIStoreFolderTable from which appropriate subclasses are
	derived for handling mails, tasks or calendar items.
	- renamed
	"getMessageTableChildproperty:atURL:withTag:inFolder:withFID:" and
	"getFolderTableChildproperty:atURL:withTag:inFolder:withFID:" to
	the simpler "getChildProperty:forKey:withTag:" form and moved them
	to the MAPIStoreTable class.
	- moved "-setRestrictions:" to MAPIStoreTable.
	- renamed "getFolderMessageKeys:matchingQualifier:" to
	"cachedChildKeys" and "cachedRestrictedChildKeys" and moved them
	to MAPIStoreTable.
	- moved all the "evaluateRestriction:intoQualifier:" methods to
	MAPIStoreTable.
	(-createMessagePropertiesWithMID:inFID:isAssociated:): now takes a
	"isAssociated" parameter to determine whether the message is part
	of the contents table or the fai table.

	* OpenChange/EOBitmaskQualifier.m (-description): new method.

2010-12-29  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	You MUST now set OCSSessionsFolderURL to a value like:
	postgresql://sogo:sogo@127.0.0.1:5432/sogo/sogo_sessions_folder
	and the database table will be created automatically upon
	next SOGo's startup.

	op_release_record.

	* OpenChange/MAPIStoreMapping.m (MAPIStoreMappingInitDictionary):

        * SoObject/SOGo/SQLSource.m - added SHA password
	hash support for SQL authentication sources.
	* Added patch from bug #1048
	* SoObjects/Mailer/SOGoDraftObject.m:
	-mimeHeaderMapWithHeaders:excluding: axed the "replyTo"
	code as it was always 'empty', leading to Reply-To being
	always set to the From: address, which is rather stupid.

2010-12-08  Francis Lachapelle  <flachapelle@inverse.ca>

	* UI/WebServerResources/MailerUI.js (onMenuEmptyTrashCallback):

	handling "needs eval" restriction types.
	(-saveOrSubmitChangesInMessageWithMID:andFlags:save:) prevent any
	creation or modification of messages with a type attribute of
	"IPM.Microsoft.FolderDesign.NamedView", at least for now, because

2010-09-02  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* UI/Contacts/UIxContactFoldersView.m (-allContactSearchAction):
	inverted the contact/list condition test as the vlist test is
	faster to execute.

	* UI/MailerUI/UIxMailView.m (_receiptMessageHeaderTo:): properly
	escape the message subject in QP when needed.

	* UI/WebServerResources/UIxMailEditor.js:
	(onMenuCheckReturnReceipt): the function has an event parameter
	which we need. This fixes an exception occurring when clicking the
	"Options" menu.

2010-09-01  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* Tests/Unit/SOGoTest.m (-run): fixed build on GNUstep >= 1.20.

	field is evaluated and where a popup is displayed accordingly.
	(onMessageConfirmMDN): new callback function for dialog mentionned
	above.

	* UI/WebServerResources/JavascriptAPIExtensions.js:
	(String.prototype.cssIdToHungarianId) new helper method that
	compose the hungarian representation from an identifier where the
	parts are separated with a dash, such as css class and id
	identifiers.

	* UI/WebServerResources/UIxPreferences.js: added code for handling
	prefs pertaining to return receipts.

	* UI/MailerUI/UIxMailView.m (-shouldAskReceipt): new accessor that
	returns a JS bool string when the current message satisfy the
	conditions required for asking the user whether to send a receipt
	or not. Additionally, it will send the receipt automatically if
	the message category falls in a category where the unconditonnal
	send is required as per the user preferences. If "ask" or "always"
	is the returned value, the "$MDNSend" flag is automatically set on
	the IMAP message, since we want to avoid asking the user twice.

	* UI/PreferencesUI/UIxPreferences.m
	(-_extractMainReceiptsPreferences:): new method for extracting
	prefs pertaining to return receipts and save them in the user
	prefs dictionary.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoUserDefaults.m (-setAllowUserReceipt:)
	(-allowUserReceipt, setUserReceiptNonRecipientAction:)
	(userReceiptNonRecipientAction)
	(setUserReceiptOutsideDomainAction:)
	(userReceiptOutsideDomainAction, setUserReceiptAnyAction:)
	(userReceiptAnyAction): new accessors pertaining to return
	receipts.

	preferences pertaining to return receipts.

2010-08-31  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* SoObjects/SOGo/NSScanner+BSJSONAdditions.m (-scanJSONValue:):
	make use of NSUInteger rather than "unsigned int" for length
	values.
	(-scanJSONNumber:): now scan float numbers too.

	* UI/WebServerResources/UIxMailEditor.js
	(onMenuCheckReturnReceipt): new function.
	(getMenus): added entries for initializing the new "Options" menu
	as well as the "Priority" menu.

	* UI/MailerUI/UIxMailEditor.m (-setReceipt, -receipt): new
	accessors for the "receipt" hidden input field, meant to interract
	the the "return receipt" entry in the "Options" menu.
	(-setReplyTo, -replyTo): removed obsolete methods.

	* SoObjects/Mailer/SOGoDraftObject.m (-setHeaders:)
	(-mimeHeaderMapWithHeaders:excluding:): added handling for the
	"Disposition-Notification-To" header.

2010-08-30  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* Tools/SOGoToolRemoveDoubles.m, UI/MailerUI/UIxMailFormatter.m:
	adapted classes to use "NSInteger" and "NSUInteger" instead of
	"int" and "unsigned int" for compatibility with versions of
	GNUstep base >= 1.20.

	* UI/WebServerResources/ckeditor/{ckeditor_source.js,ckeditor_basic_source.js,ckeditor.pack}:
	dropped useless files.

	* UI/WebServerResources/UIxPreferences.js: (appendSieveFilterRow):
	we bind the "click" event on the activation checkbox rather than
	"change", because a certain obsolete browser simply ignores it.
	(updateFilterFromEditor): the "filter" argument is replaced with a
	JSON-encoded string representing the filter in question. On a
	certain obsolete browser, object referencing is so messed up that
	closing the "creator" window will suddenly invalidate the created
	objects. This solves the voodoo error message "The callee (server
	[not server application]) is not available and disappeared; all
	connections are invalid." when saving and closing.
	(setupMailboxesFromJSON): new method, created due the same issue
	as above, that enables the creation of an array from the response
	received by the filter editing window.
	(updateSieveFilterRow): we avoid removing the activation cb since
	further update event would no longer be taken into account.
	However we reset its "checked" status to the activation status of
	the updated filter.

2010-08-26  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* SoObjects/SOGo/NSString+Utilities.m (-asQPSubjectString:): we
	use "NGEncodeQuotedPrintableMime" instead of
	"dataByEncodingQuotedPrintable" (NGQuotedPrintableCoding), as it's
	more suited for email header fields.

	* SoObjects/Mailer/SOGoDraftObject.m (_quoteSpecials:): now work
	on single strings.
	(_quoteSpecialsInArray:): new method that offers the same
	functionality as _quoteSpecials: did before the change above.

	* UI/MailerUI/UIxMailEditor.m (_emailFromIdentity:): the "from"
	field is handled in SOGoDraftObject, therefore we don't need to
	modify it here, especially since this will alterate the display.

	* Tests/Unit/TestNGMimeAddressHeaderFieldGenerator.m: new test
	module for NGMimeAddressHeaderFieldGenerator.

2010-08-25  Francis Lachapelle  <flachapelle@inverse.ca>

	* UI/WebServerResources/SchedulerUI.js (copyEventToClipboard)
	(copyEventFromClipboard, copyEventToPersonalCalendar, copyEvents):
	new functions to allow the copy/paste of events.
	(selectCalendarEvent): fixed various bugs with the selection of
	events.
	(onMenuCurrentViewPrepareVisibility): new function to disable the
	delete option when no event is selected and to disable the copy
	option when the event is owned by the user.
	(onDocumentKeydown): added actions for Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V.
	(deleteEvent): avoid showing a confirmation dialog with recurrent
	events that the user can't erase.

	* UI/WebServerResources/SOGoDataTable.js: Overrided methods from
	HTMLElement (selectRange, selectAll) to handle selection based on rows ID.


	* UI/WebServerResources/MailerUI.js: selected messages are now
	identified by their row ID to handle live loading.

	* UI/WebServerResources/HTMLElement.js (getSelectedNodesId): take
	advantage of the selectedIds attribute.
	(selectElement): also verify if the element is in the selectedIds
	array.
	(deselectAll): performance improvement; unselect elements based on
	the _selected class.

	* UI/Scheduler/UIxAppointmentActions.m (-copyAction): new method
	to copy the appointment to a different calendar.

	* SoObjects/Appointments/SOGoCalendarComponent.m
	(-copyComponent:toFolder:): was copyToFolder. This new method
	accepts a specific calendar component.
	(-copyToFolder:): uses the above method with the current calendar.

2010-08-25  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* UI/Contacts/UIxListEditor.m: slightly improved code at various
	places.

2010-08-25  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

        * It's now possible to use SSL or TLS for the
	SOGoIMAPServer value. Also updated the documentation
	to give samples. Fixed the "port" value save from
	the preferences module.

2010-08-24  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* UI/WebServerResources/generic.js: (log): added a hack to enable
	child windows to log messages in the log console of the main window.

	* SoObjects/Contacts/SOGoContactGCSList.m (-davAddressData): added
	method.

2010-08-24  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* UI/Templates/PreferencesUI/UIxPreferences.wox
	Enabled the UI widgets related to SSL/TLS.
	SOPE *must* be updated for them to work properly.

2010-08-23  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* UI/WebServerResources/UIxMailEditor.js: (clickEditorSend): make
	use of the iframe hack for receiving the POST's response and
	interpret it as JSON, with error handling.

	* UI/WebServerResources/HTMLElement.js: (Element.allTextContent):
	fetch the concatenated text content of the all the child nodes of
	the element, recursively.

	* UI/WebServerResources/MailerUI.js: (initMailer): use
	"UserSettings" only if we are the main window.

	* UI/MailerUI/UIxMailEditor.m (-sendAction): return a json
	representation of the success of the operation, with a message if
	an exception was returned.

	* UI/WebServerResources/MailerUI.js: (mailListToggleMessagesRead):
	new method, spun from "mailListMarkMessage", which is basically
	replaces in a more generic way by acting on all selected messages
	in the msg list.
	(mailListToggleMessagesFlagged): same as above for
	"mailListFlagMessageToggle".
	(onMenuToggleMessageRead, onMenuToggleMessageFlag): new menu
	callback methods.
	(onMarkMenuPrepareVisibility): new visibility method for the
	"mark-menu".
	(getMenus): activated the "mark as read" and "toggle flag" menu
	options of the "mark menu".

2010-08-20  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoDAVAuthenticator.m (-checkLogin:password:):
	same as below.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoUser.m (-initWithLogin:roles:trust:): same as
	below.

	renamed from "isAddressBookApp".
	(-isIPhoneAddressBookApp): new method to detect whether the
	request has been performed from the AB of iOS.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoFolder.m (-davEntityTag): we no return a
	pseudo etag for collections for compatibility with the broken
	Apple clients.

2010-08-19  Francis Lachapelle  <flachapelle@inverse.ca>

	* UI/WebServerResources/generic.js (showConfirmDialog): new
	function to replace window.confirm().

	* UI/WebServerResources/MailerUI.js (onMenuEmptyTrash): delete the
	cache of the trash mailbox when called.

2010-08-19  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* Tools/sogo-ealarms-notify.m: new tool meant to be executed every
	minute from cron for handling email alarms notifications.

	* SoObjects/Appointments/SOGoEMailAlarmsManager.[hm]: new GCS
	aware singleton class for main email alarms operations on the db.

	* SoObjects/Mailer/SOGoMailFolder.m (-deleteUIDs:inContext:): make
	the use of the "result" variable clearer by declaring it with a
	proper class name and avoiding type confusion within the code.

	* UI/WebServerResources/MailerUI.js: (initDnd): removed useless
	method.
	(onMessageListPrepareVisibility): fixed a bug where the current
	mailbox name would be attemptedly taken from the menu target,
	while it really should have been deduced from
	"Mailer.currentMailbox".
	(configureDraggables): we now take all label nodes under
	"#mailboxTree" into account and accept them as droppable when they
	are not an account node. Also, we associate an account tag with
	all of them.
	(startDragging): we set the drag classname of the drag handle to
	the correct account tag, to avoid visual feedback when hovering
	mailboxes from another account.

	* UI/WebServerResources/UIxReminderEditor.js
	(initialiseFormValues): added code to configure the "actionList"
	if present (email alarms enabled).
	(onEditorOkClick): modify the parent's reminderAction,
	reminderEmailOrganizer, reminderEmailAttendees when email alarms
	are available. "reminderAction" is conditionally set to "display"
	otherwise.

	* UI/Scheduler/UIxReminderEditor.m (-emailAlarmsEnabled): new accessor.

	* SoObjects/Appointments/SOGoCalendarComponent.m
	(-saveComponent:): invoke SOGoEMailAlarmsManager to register any
	email alarms in the saved component.
	(-PUTAction:): new super method to perform the same as the above.
	(-prepareDelete): new super method. Invoke SOGoEMailAlarmsManager
	to unregister any email alarms in the deleted component.

	* UI/Scheduler/UIxComponentEditor.m (-init): added the
	"reminderAction", "reminderEmailOrganizer" and
	"reminderEmailAttendees" ivars.
	(_loadEMailAlarm:) new setup method for setting up parameters that
	are specific to email alarms.
	(_appendAttendees:toEmailAlarm:,_appendOrganizerToEmailAlarm:):
	new method for adding "attendees" to email alarms.
	(-emailAlarmsEnabled): new accessor.

	* SoObjects/Appointments/SOGoAppointmentObject.m (-prepareDelete):
	we now invoke -[super prepareDelete] since SOGoCalendarComponent
	now implements the method.
	(-DELETEAction:): invoke -prepareDelete instead of
	-prepareDeleteOccurence: since we want -[super prepareDelete] to
	be invoked from here too.

	* Main/SOGo.m (-_checkMandatoryTables): added code to create the
	alarms table if email alarms are enabled.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoSystemDefaults.m (-enableEMailAlarms): new
	method for the "SOGoEnableEMailAlarms" user default.

2010-08-19  Francis Lachapelle  <flachapelle@inverse.ca>

	* UI/WebServerResources/generic.js (showPromptDialog): new
	function to replace window.prompt().

2010-08-13  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* SoObjects/Appointments/iCalEvent+SOGo.m (-quickRecord): we now
	make use of the new -[iCalAlarm nextAlarmDate] method.

	* SoObjects/Appointments/iCalToDo+SOGo.m (-quickRecord): we now
	make use of the new -[iCalAlarm nextAlarmDate] method.

2010-08-12  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* UI/WebServerResources/MailerUIdTree.js: (getMailboxNode): fixed
	method to return unfolded nodes too.

	* UI/WebServerResources/MailerUI.js: (updateUnseenCount): renamed
	from "updateStatusFolders" and improved to use DOM methods.

	* UI/WebServerResources/dtree.js: (Node): removed the "hasUnseen"
	parameter.

	* UI/MailerUI/UIxMailAccountActions.m (-listMailboxes): make use
	of the "application/json" content type in the response.

	* UI/MailerUI/UIxMailFolderActions.m: (-unseenCount): renamed and
	moved implementation of the -[UIxMailAccountActions statusFolders]
	method, splitted thereof since we now execute the method on all
	mail folders.

	* UI/MailerUI/UIxMailMainFrame.m (-defaultColumnsOrder): removed
	accessor, made obsolete by the new propagation mechanism of user
	defaults.
	(-getUnseenCountForAllFolders): new accessor that returns the
	value below as a string value.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoDomainDefaults.m (-mailCheckAllUnseenCounts):
	new method returning whether the unseen count of all mailboxes
	should be checked.

	* SoObjects/Mailer/SOGoMailAccount.m (-updateFilters): when the
	first login attempt fails, we must request a new password to the
	authenticator (as intended originally).

	* UI/WebServerResources/generic.js: (onAjaxRequestStateChange):
	when using CAS authentication and when the return code is 0 and
	when the request status is 4, chances are that the initial ajax
	request failed due to the expiration of the CAS ticket entry in
	memcached. In FF 3.5 and above, a bug prevents the initial cookie
	from being given back to the reauthentication redirect from an
	AJAX request. Therefore we open a window that will do this for us
	and will close one the authentication has succeeded again.

	* UI/MainUI/SOGoRootPage.m (-revoverAction): new fake action that
	perform the CAS redirection and then trigger the respawn of the
	initial request.

	* UI/Common/UIxPageFrame.m (-usesCASAuthentication): new accessor
	used for recovery of redirected requests.

	* SoObjects/Contacts/SOGoFolder+CardDAV.m:
	(_appendObject:withBaseURL:toREPORTResponse:): moved method here
	from SOGOContact{GCS,Source}Folder since its implementation was
	mostly the same in the two classes and never invoked anywhere
	else.
	Modified to return both "address-data" and "addressbook-data"
	(draft rev < 4) unless we parse the requested props appropriately.

	* SoObjects/Contacts/SOGoContactGCSFolder.m
	(-davAddressbookMultiget): new method that responds the
	CardDAV addressbook-multiget report.
	(-davSQLFieldsTable): new overriden method that adds support for
	the CardDAV address-data property.

	* SoObjects/Appointments/SOGoAppointmentFolder.m
	(-davCalendarMultiget:): make use of the new method below.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoGCSFolder.m
	(-performMultigetInContext:inNamespace:): collection-type
	independent form of -[SOGoAppointmentFolder davCalendarMultiget:],
	moved along with all its private methods.

	* SoObjects/Contacts/SOGoContactFolders.m
	(-toManyRelationshipKeys): new overriden method to return only the
	personal addressbook when the request is performed by
	AddressBook.app.

2010-08-11  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* SoObjects/Appointments/SOGoAppointmentObject.m
	Removed all the old calendar-schedule code and
	instead, implemented calendar-auto-schedule. The old
	code will always succeed and the new code reuses
	all the business logic used for the Web interface
	of SOGo.
	* SOPE/NGCards/iCalRecurrenceRule.m
	Modified setInterval: so that when the value is
	equal to 1, we do NOT set it.
	* UI/WebServerResources/UIxAclEditor.js
	In addUserCallback(), we remove the owner of the
	resource if it was added. This fixes #682.
	* We now correctly encode/decode the '&'
	character in the mailbox name when copying and moving
	messages and also when opening mailboxes. This
	fixes #716.

2010-08-11  Francis Lachapelle  <flachapelle@inverse.ca>

	* UI/WebServerResources/MailerUI.js (refreshMessage): if the
	current mailbox is the sent folder, refresh the mailbox instead of
	only the message.

2010-08-11  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* UI/WebServerResources/SchedulerUI.js: (initCalendars): avoid
	setting "showCompletedTasks" when in a popup, since this needs
	access to a UserDefaults dictionary which is not present nor event
	required.

	* Main/SOGo+DAV.m (-davCurrentUserPrincipal): new method
	implementing the "{DAV:}current-user-principal" property.

	* SoObjects/Contacts/SOGoContactGCSEntry.m (-davAddressData): new
	DAV property accessor returning the card content.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/WORequest+SOGo.m (-isAddressBookApp): new
	(hackish) test method to determine whether the client is Apple's
	AddressBook.app.

	* UI/Common/UIxPageFrame.m (_dictionaryWithKeys:fromSource:):
	set an NSNull as value for keys which return no results, in order
	to avoid an NSInvalidArgumentException.

2010-08-10  Francis Lachapelle  <flachapelle@inverse.ca>

	* UI/WebServerResources/generic.js (showAlertDialog): new function
	to replace window.alert().

2010-08-09  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* UI/WebServerResources/MailerUI.js (openMailbox): removed the
	"updateStatus" parameter, which is never used.

	* UI/WebServerResources/generic.js (log): fixed handling of
	messages ending with "\n".

	* UI/Common/UIxPageFrame.m (-setUserDefaultsKeys:)
	(-hasUserDefaultsKeys, -setUserSettingsKeys:)
	(-hasUserSettingsKeys): new accessor for determining explicitly
	which user defaults/settings keys are returned. The new
	corresponding ivars are "udKeys" and "usKeys" respectively.
	(-userDefaults, -userSettings): rewrote methods to create a
	dictionary containing only the requested keys (see above). Since
	the source are now explicitly queried, the values can now be
	inherited from the domain and system defaults.

	* UI/WebServerResources/UIxFilterEditor.js (loadMailboxes): the
	first account is now always identitied with "0", therefore we no
	longer need the "firstMailAccount" variable.

	* UI/PreferencesUI/UIxFilterEditor.m (-firstMailAccount): removed
	osbolete accessor.

	* UI/WebServerResources/UIxPreferences.js: (onMailAccountAdd)
	(onMailAccountDelete): set "hasChanged" to 1 when triggered.
	(onColorPickerChoice): don't invoke "onChoiceChanged" as it is an
	event callback.

2010-08-06  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* UI/WebServerResources/generic.js (reloadPreferences): dropped
	useless method.

	* UI/PreferencesUI/UIxPreferences.m (_extractAuxiliaryAccounts:):
	since we no longer transfer the user password to the client, the
	old password has to be fetched from the old account unless a new
	password has been set.
	(-mailAccounts): we now strip the passwords from the returned mail
	accounts, to avoid transferring them uselessly with a risk of
	keeping them in cache.

	* UI/WebServerResources/MailerUI.js: (initMailboxTree): make use
	of the new class below and drop all code related to keeping track
	of active requests.

	* UI/WebServerResources/generic.js: (AjaxRequestsChain): new class
	that implements the chaining of ajax requests.

	* UI/WebServerResources/MailerUI.js: (dropAction): ensure that the
	destination mailbox is in the same mail account as the message
	being dragged.
	(getMenus): arranged menu descriptions as as single statement.
	Added "prepareVisibility" callbacks for the "messageListMenu",
	"messagesListMenu" and "messageContentMenu" (move/copy ops) and
	"inboxIconMenu", "trashIconMenu", "mailboxIconMenu" menus (folder
	sharing).
	(onMessageListMenuPrepareVisibility): new vis. callback designed
	to attach the right folder submenu to the copy and move ops.
	(onFolderMenuPrepareVisibility): new vis. cb for disabling the
	share of folders for auxiliary accounts.
	(updateMailboxMenus): simplified method by removing the first
	level of submenus, where the account names used to be.
	(openInbox): "openMailbox" only takes 3 parameters. Using "null"
	instead of "false" was also pretty lame.
	(updateStatusFolders): take the mailbox name as parameter and
	arranged for multiple mail accounts. In particular, "unseenCount"
	is now a class identifier rather than an element id.
	(markMailInWindow): make use of
	MailerUIdTreeExtension.getMailboxNode.

	* UI/WebServerResources/ContactsUI.js
	(onToolbarDeleteSelectedContacts): use translated labels.

	* UI/WebServerResources/MailerUIdTree.js:
	(MailerUIdTreeExtension._addFolderNode): no longer set a SPAN
	arroung the unseen count.
	(MailerUIdTreeExtension.getMailboxNode): new method returning the
	DIV.dTreeNode corresponding to the mailbox name passed as
	parameter.

	* UI/WebServerResources/UIxPreferences.js: (_setupEvents): no
	longer take any parameter, which simplifies the method, as
	removing the "change" observers on input field is not useful.
	(initMailAccounts): new method that parses the mail accounts JSON
	dictionary, populates the mail account UL and setup related
	events.
	(onMailAccountInfoChange, onMailIdentityInfoChange)
	(onMailIdentitySignatureClick, onMailIdentitySignatureOK)
	(createMailAccountLI, onMailAccountEntryClick, displayMailAccount)
	(displayAccountSignature, createMailAccount)
	(onMailAccountAdd, onMailAccountDelete, saveMailAccounts)
	(compactMailAccounts): new methods completing the above.

	* UI/PreferencesUI/UIxPreferences.m (-identitiesList)
	(-itemIdentityText, -signature, -setSignature): removed obsolete
	methods.
	(-defaultAction): when updating filters, we now only need to query
	the "0" account since accounts are no longer identified by "name".
	(-mailAuxiliaryUserAccountsEnabled): new bool method.
	(-setMailAccounts): new accessor that decodes the new mail
	accounts dictionary in JSON format and validates it prior to save
	it in the user defaults.
	(-mailAccounts): new accessor.

	* UI/MailerUI/UIxMailFolderActions.m (_setFolderPurpose:): we now
	use the corresponding methods on the SOGoUserDefaults instance
	rather than in the user settings (old bug) when setting folders
	for the main account. Additionally, we now handle the entries from
	auxiliary accounts.

	* UI/MailerUI/UIxMailEditor.m (-fromEmails): the list of
	identities is now taken from the corresponding mail account dict.

	* SoObjects/Mailer/SOGoMailForward.m (-signature): same as below.

	* UI/MailerUI/UIxMailAccountActions.m (-composeAction): same as below.

	* SoObjects/Mailer/SOGoDraftObject.m (-fetchMailForForwarding):
	the signature is now taken from the original mail's corresponding
	account.

	* SoObjects/Mailer/SOGoMailFolder.m
	(-copyUIDs:toFolder:inContext:): we now ensure that the operation
	is not attempted on two separate accounts.
	(-httpURLForAdvisoryToUser): the returned mail account is now
	always "0".

	* SoObjects/Mailer/SOGoMailBaseObject.m (-imap4URL): we now add
	the "tls=YES" url parameter if the corresponding account
	encryption is set to "tls".
	(-imap4Login): removed useless method.
	(-imap4PasswordRenewed:): now a proxy to the same method on the
	instance account folder.

	* SoObjects/Mailer/SOGoMailAccount.m (-identities, -signature)
	(encryption): new helper methods that return the corresponding key
	in the appropriate mail account dictionary.
	(-_migrateFolderWithPurpose:): moved method in SOGoMailAccount.m.
	(-_userFolderNameWithPurpose): rewrote method to make use of the
	mail account dictionaries. Fallback on the main account of the
	auxiliary ones do not have the required entry.
	(-imap4PasswordRenewed:): moved method from SOGoMailBaseObject.m
	and use the "password" entry in auxiliary account dicts depending

	in the array of user mail accounts, which simplifies this method.
	We also handle the "encryption" key, albeit currently unused, and
	we now add the port to the url as needed.

	bind the "unload" event rather than "beforeunload", which does not
	seem to work on IE.

	* UI/WebServerResources/UIxAclEditor.js (onAclLoadHandler): add
	tooltips to the special user entries.

	(-toOneRelationShipKeys): with a request from iCal, we return
	nothing to avoid confusing iCal 3 with non-collection resources.

	* UI/Common/UIxAclEditor.m (-isPublicAccessEnabled): we now expose
	the state of public access in order to not show the "anonymous"
	user when not needed.

2010-06-03  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* UI/WebServerResources/generic.js (CurrentModule): new function
	that returns the name of the currently active module.

	* UI/WebServerResources/UIxAclEditor.js (addUser): take into
	account the fact that the "default roles" button has been replaced
	with a new "authenticated users" entry and that we want to keep
	that entry at the end of the list.
	(nodeForUser): added a "canSubscribe" parameter that determines
	whether the "subcribe user" button should be displayed.
	(openRightsForUserId): when the user id is "anonymous", the acl
	window is reduced by 42 pixels. If the window to display is the
	one pertaining to contacts rights, 21 pixels are substracted again.
	(openRightsForDefaultUser): removed function.

	* UI/Scheduler/UIxCalUserRightsEditor.m (-objectRights): the list
	of rights must be limited to the immutative ones whe the active

	excape the value for the "user" attribute with
	xml.sax.saxutils.escape.

	* Tests/Integration/webdavlib.py (HTTPPUT.__init__): added the
	"content_type" and "exclusive" optional parameters. The latter
	implies the use of the "if-none-match" header.
	(WebDAVPUT): removed useless operation class

	* SoObjects/SOGo/WORequest+SOGo.m (-handledByDefaultHandler):
	fixed a bug where the -requestHandlerKey method would be invoked
	on the "request" (NGHttpRequest) ivar rather than on self.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoUserFolder.m (_subFoldersFromFolder:):
	thanks to the change below, the ACL checking code is no longer
	needed here, where we can now concentrate on returning subfolders
	metadata.

	the owner of the current parent folder, subfolders are returned

	"personal" subfolder.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoGCSFolder.m (-aclsForUser:forObjectAtPath:):
	extracted db code into a new "_realAclsForUser:forObjectAtPath:"

	the active user is the owner of the current parent folder.

	returned user has the login "anonymous", we return a corresponding
	instance of SOGoUser to make sure methods are never invoked on
	SoUser instances.

	use of the new "isInPublicZone" method of SOGoObject to give the
	"PublicUser" role to the unauthenticated user.

	but we cache the result in a new "isInPublicZone" ivar.

	* Main/SOGo.m (-lookupName:inContext:acquire): when the "public"
	key is requested in DAV mode, we now instantiate a
	"SOGoPublicBaseFolder", if the "SOGoEnablePublicAccess" user

	meant to be called from child objects.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoPublicBaseFolder.m: new class module that
	enables anonymous access to resources. Instantiated from the
	"SOGo" object. Implements a method "-isInPublicZone" that always
	returns "YES".

2010-06-02  Francis Lachapelle  <flachapelle@inverse.ca>

	* UI/Scheduler/UIxCalListingActions.m (_userStateInEvent): fixed
	array indexes that would cause the user participation state to no
	longer be returned.

2010-06-01  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* SoObjects/SOGo/WORequest+SOGo.m (-handledByDefaultHandler): test
	the request handler key instead of invoking isSoWebDAVRequest,
	which performs additional and permission tests.

	* Tests/Integration/test-davacl.py
	(DAVCalendarAclTest._testRights): reenabled test code even when no
	classification rights are available.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoSystemDefaults.m (-enablePublicAccess): new

	webdavlib.py into accounts with regards to XPath queries.

	* SoObjects/Appointments/SOGoAppointmentFolder.m
	(-_privacySqlString): renamed to the new standardized
	"aclSQLListingFilter". Again, a difference is now made between
	empty and nil return strings, which we now apply here too.
	(-bareFetchFields:from:to:title:component:additionalFilters:,
	(-fetchFields:from:to:title:component:additionalFilters:includeProtectedInformation:):
	make use of the new semantics to the above method.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoGCSFolder.m (-aclSQLListingFilter): new
	overridable method designed to return a filter to SQL queries that
	avoids requesting records that are not meant to be visible to the
	active user. Replaces and extends -[SOGoAppointmentFolder
	_privacySqlString] with the additional convention that returning a
	nil string will prevent any query at all.
	(-toOneRelationshipKeys): new overriden method (see below). Make
	use of the new aclSQLListingFilter method to retrieve records so
	that unaccessible records are not even listed.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoFolder.m (-fetchContentObjectNames): removed
	this useless alias to "toOneRelationshipKeys".

	* Tests/Integration/all.py: disable multilanguage tests by
	default, reverting the "disbale-languages" cmd-line parameter to
	"enable-languages".

	* Tests/Integration/webdavlib.py (WebDAVClient.__init__): made
	"username" and "password" parameters optional to enable anonymous
	connections. Also, M2Crypto.httpslib is imported explicitly only
	when an SSL connection is requested. This renders this library
	optional.
	(WebDAVQuery.set_response): we now make use of the xml.etree API
	instead of the one from xml.dom.
	(xpath_evaluate): the above change makes this method obsolete
	since XPath queries can now be performed directly on returned
	elements.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoCache.m (-setValue:forKey:expire:): display
	the memcached error string when an error occurs.

2010-05-28  Francis Lachapelle  <flachapelle@inverse.ca>

	of the elements themselves.

	* UI/MailerUI/UIxMailMainFrame.m (-showToAddress,
	-columnsMetaData, -columnsMetaData, -columnsDisplayOrder,

	hours to the day start hour and day end hour, respectively,
	instead of the event start and end time.

	(resolveListAttendeesCallback): callback for the above, that
	create rows and input fields corresponding to the returned

	"attendeesEditor.currentField" is no longer used.
	(performSearchCallbacks): roles and partstats are now stored in
	individual attributes rather than in the element class. We also
	now behave differently depending on whether the event owner is
	returned or another type of user, in order to match Lightning's
	behaviour.
	(newAttendee): no longer a callback, and now takes an optional
	argument that indicates with attendee row precedes the one being
	created. Also the new row is returned.

	(delegateIsAttendee:andClientObject:): handle the case where the
	user is found but has no RSVP or one with "FALSE" as value.

	return the attendee matching the user, whether he/she is a
	participant or not.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/iCalEntityObject+Utilities.[hm]: removed useless
	module, since it implemented methods already found elsewhere.

2010-05-04  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* UI/WebServerResources/ContactsUI.js (initContacts): we must
	configure the ab toolbar even when in popup mode, provided
	"tabsContainer" does resolve to an existing element since the
	script will be included for utility windows too.

2010-05-04  Francis Lachapelle  <flachapelle@inverse.ca>

	* SoObjects/Contacts/SOGoContactSourceFolder.m
	(-lookupName:inContext:acquire:): verify the result of

	they do not limit the amount of records that can be exported.

	* Tools/SOGoToolBackup.m (-proceed): we empty the autorelease pool

	LDAP compliance.

	* SoObjects/Contacts/SOGoContactSourceFolder.m
	(_flattenedRecord:): new method with the repetitive code from
	_flattenedRecords. Snipped to offer the same functionality with

	* SoObjects/Contacts/SOGoContactGCSFolder.m
	(_qualifierForFilter:): adjusted qualifiers to perform the same
	search that Thundebird perform in its local abooks.

	DAV:principal-property-search

2010-04-20  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoUser.m (-mailAccounts): use the user's first
	email address as displayname for the mail account. Also, we avoid
	autoreleasing objects that do not required to.

	* UI/MailPartViewers/UIxMailPartHTMLViewer.m
	(-startElement:namespace:rawName:attributes:): "ignoreContent" is
	no longer a BOOL but an int, and was renamed to "ignoredContent".
	This enables to fix a bug where an ignored content tag could be
	"unignored" by being closed more than once, triggering the passing
	of further content though the sanitizer.
	Also, we now rename the "classid" and "data" attributes of "object"
	elements to prevent cross-site scripting.
	(+initialize): "applet", "frame", "frameset" and "iframe" a now
	banned tags too.

2010-04-19  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* UI/Scheduler/UIxComponentEditor.m (-_loadRRules): added support
	for all the rules that can be defined from the Web interface:
	custom yearly/monthly/daily rules.
	(-_handleCustomRRule:): idem.

	* UI/WebServerResources/UIxRecurrenceEditor.js: added support for
	custom monthly and yearly occurrences.

	* UI/Scheduler/UIxCalListingActions.m (:_fixDates): the recurrence
	ID must be adjusted even when in the month view.

	* UI/Scheduler/UIxAppointmentEditor.m (-viewAction): no longer
	necessary to adjust event date with the daylight saving time.

2010-04-19  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* UI/Contacts/UIxContactFolderActions.m (-exportAction): improved
	method by providing the encoded filename of the address book
	following rfc2047. Make the "uids" parameter optional: when
	omitted, the address book is exported completely.

	* UI/WebServerResources/ContactsUI.js (getMenus): added entry for
	exporting the address books, slightly reorganized the entries.
	(onAddressBooksMenuPrepareVisibility): grey out the "export" entry
	for LDAP address books.

	from the contextual menu.

	* SoObjects/Appointments/SOGoCalendarComponent.m
	(-lookupOccurence:): the looked up occurrence might be the master
	event.

	* UI/WebServerResources/UIxMailPopupView.js (initPopupMailer): we
	assign window.messageUID from here now (by concatenating
	"mailboxName" and "messageName", as it will disappear if the
	window is reloaded.

2010-04-15  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* UI/WebServerResources/SchedulerUI.js (onDocumentKeydown): when
	deleting an event, we must make sure that the even dialog
	disappears, as it the case with the click on the corresponding
	toolbar button.

	* Tools/SOGoToolRemove.m: new sogo-tool utility to remove user
	data from the database.

	* Tools/SOGoSockDOperation.m (_appendEntry:toResult:): include
	"telephonenumber" in the entry information.

2010-04-14  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* UI/WebServerResources/MailerUI.js (onMenuArchiveFolder): new
	menu callback method that invokes "exportFolder" on the target
	mailbox.
	(saveAs): we use "window.location.href" instead of "window.open"
	when exporting messages, as it avoids the flickering of opening an
	ephemeral window.

	* UI/MailerUI/UIxMailFolderActions.m (-exportFolderAction): new
	action that triggers the archiving of the selected folder.

	* SoObjects/Mailer/SOGoMailFolder.m
	(-archiveUIDs:inArchiveNamed:inContext:): new version of

	argument, to be used as the filename of the attachment in the mime
	headers of the response. Fixed a bug naming the messages following
	their identifier's address rather than their identifier. We now
	encode the provided filename as a qp utf-8 string when needed.
	(-archiveAllMessagesInContext:): new method that uses the above
	method for archiving all the messages in an archive named after
	the folder's IMAP name.

	* UI/WebServerResources/SchedulerUI.js (onDocumentKeydown): new
	callback method for handling keypresses. Initial code handles
	event/task deletion.

	* UI/WebServerResources/generic.js (onRowClick): fixed a typo.

2010-04-13  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* UI/WebServerResources/UIxContactEditor.js (initEditorForm): we

	use the "authorization" header to determine the password of the
	user, if any.

	* SoObjects/Appointments/SOGoAptMailReceipt.m (-getSubject)

	SOGoAptMailNotification, to avoid a crash regarding a lock of
	method override.

	handling tabs, replacing non-object code from generic.js. Added
	handling of tab overflows, with the appearance of two left/right
	buttons to make them scroll.

2010-04-09  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* UI/MailPartViewers/UIxMailPartICalActions.m
	(_eventObjectWithUID:forUser:): fixed a typo that would cause the

	(-updateUserStatusAction): return a 404 status code when the
	corresponding event is not found.

	* SoObjects/Mailer/SOGoMailFolder.m (-aclsForUser:): don't fetch

	* SoObjects/Appointments/SOGoAptMailUpdate.m,
	SoObjects/Appointments/SOGoAptMailInvitation.m,
	SoObjects/Appointments/SOGoAptMailICalReply.m,
	SoObjects/Appointments/SOGoAptMailDeletion.m: revamped to make use
	of language dictionaries rather than language-specific classes.
	This hugely simplifies the code and ease the job of implementing
	languages for SOGo.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoObject.m (-labelForKey:) removed method,
	obsoleted by the new one below.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/NSObject+Utilities.m (-labelForKey:inContext:):
	new method that enables the querying of module based language
	dictionaries from non SoComponent instances.

	(WebDAVTest.testExpandProperty): same as below

	* Tests/Integration/test-caldav-scheduling.py (fetchUserInfo):
	accept empty displayname property.

	* Tests/Integration/test-maildav.py: temporarily disabled test

	compliant with rfc822.

2010-04-07  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* UI/MailPartViewers/UIxMailPartICalActions.m

	exists only in the specified user's calendar, as it may already
	exists in subcribed calendars belonging to other attendees.

	* SoObjects/Mailer/SOGoMailFolder.m (-toManyRelationshipKeys): we
	now check if the mailbox exists before returning the message
	identifiers.
	(-lookupName:inContext:acquire:): we no longer check whether the
	folder exists as it causes problems when it is a "noselect" parent
	folder. Existence of folders is thus checked only when messages
	are accessed.

	* SoObjects/Mailer/SOGoMailAccount.m
	(_appendNamespace:toFolders:): it may happen that the namespace
	"folders" have already been added via the list command, therefore
	we now ensure that the folder names do not already exist before
	adding them to the array.

2010-04-06  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* UI/WebServerResources/UIxPreferences.js (prototypeIfyFilters):
	we don't attempt to duplicate the rules if they don't exist.

	expire value when using ppolicy.

	* UI/Contacts/UIxContactEditor.m
	We now use URL: in cards w/o a home/work preferred
	value as a home URL.

	* UI/Contacts/UIxContactEditor.m
	We now fallback to TEL;VOICE: when neither HOME
	or WORK are defined. We set that value as the
	WORK telephone number in this particular case.

2010-04-02  Francis Lachapelle  <flachapelle@inverse.ca>

	* SoObjects/Appointments/SOGoCalendarComponent.m
	(-sendEMailUsingTemplateNamed:forObject:previousObject:toAttendees:):
	when looking for the organizer email, we now rely on the previous

	important when the organizer is deleting the only attendee of an event.

	* UI/WebServerResources/SchedulerUI.js (onClickableCellsDblClick):
	hack to ignore double-click in the scrollbar in the month view &
	fix for Firefox.

	* SoObjects/Mailer/SOGoDraftObject.m (+initialize): updated the
	User-Agent header with the proper version.

	* SoObjects/Contacts/SOGoContactSourceFolder.m
	(-lookupName:inContext:acquire:): lookup the object in the
	"childRecords" cache prior to fetching it from the source. If the
	latter happens, the resulting record is cached.
	(-lookupContactsWithFilter:sortBy:ordering:): populate the
	"childRecords" cache with resulting records to avoid further
	lookups of the same data.

	typo that could potentially cause crashes.

2010-03-29  Ludovic Marcotte <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	SoObjects/Appointments/SOGoWebAppointmentFolder.m

	* UI/PreferencesUI/UIxPreferences.m (-setHasChanged:)
	(-hasChanged): restored accessors.
	(-defaultAction): when "hasChanged" is YES, we request a reload of
	the parent window. This feature was carelessly removed recently.

2010-03-25  Francis Lachapelle  <flachapelle@inverse.ca>

	* UI/WebServerResources/UIxContactsUserFolders.js
	(onFolderSearchKeyDown, buildUsersTree): change color of search

	preference (and its associated code to handle
	it in SOGoAppointmentObject.m) to force
	transparency on all-day events coming from
	the iPhone-OS based devices.

2010-03-18  Ludovic Marcotte <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* Replaced SOGoUIxUserCanChangePassword with
	SOGoPasswordChangeEnabled

	* Removed unused prefs / code.

2010-03-15  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoUserFolder.m (-davUsersQuery): we invoke
	"prepareDAVResponse" only when there is content to return.

	* UI/Scheduler/UIxCalListingActions.m (_fixDates:): the events
	appearing in the month view needs to have their dates fixed too.
	Also, the algorithm was lightly simplified.

	* Improved the password policy code. All corner
	cases should now be handled correctly.

2010-03-12  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* SoObjects/Appointments/SOGoAppointmentObject.m
	(-newOccurenceWithID): moved timezone handling code from
	UIxAppointmentEditor to here. Simplified that code.

2010-03-11  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoUserFolder.m (_davFetchUsersMatching:): we
	were still using the "info" field from the result set for extra
	user info, however that field as been renamed "c_info" a couple of
	months ago.

	* UI/WebServerResources/generic.js (SetLogMessage): we must attach
	the message to the container even when the message is null.

2010-03-10  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	(_setCalendarProperty:forKey:): replaced method with a new
	and more generic accessor from SOGoGCSFolder
	"setFolderPropertyValue:inCategory:".

	now JSON-encoded arrays, which avoids a lot of parsing issues and
	reduces the size of the code.

	* UI/WebServerResources/generic.js (IsCharacterKey): new helper
	function that returns whether the pressed keycode is one that
	changes the content of input fields.
	(onSearchKeyDown): simplified method by making use of the new
	function above.
	(onSearchBlur): clear the timer if the field is empty, to avoid a
	useless search on the ghost phrase.

	search timeout to 500 ms instead of 1 sec.

	(onChoiceChanged): removed obsolete callback.

	* UI/PreferencesUI/UIxPreferences.m (-init): removed the
	"hasChanged" and "composeMessageTypeHasChanged" ivars, as they are
	no longer needed.
	(-setHasChanged, -hasChanged): removed obsolete accessors.

	here, so that they are output to the redirected output stream.
	Added version number to "starting" line.

2010-02-18  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* UI/MailerUI/UIxMailFolderActions.m: Modified the
	code so that we correctly subscribe/unsubscribe to
	the folders (old/new) when renaming or deleting
	a folder. Also corrected the creation of subfolders
	by using -absoluteImap4Name.

2010-02-18  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	(-run): make use of the newly publicized SOGoProductLoader for

	cache has expired, we create a "cas-location" cookie before
	redirecting to the CAS login page and we redirect the user back to
	that page when the login has been completed. This way, the
	event creation window or any AJAX request would seamlessly restart
	where "interrupted" by the login process.

	* SoObjects/Appointments/SOGoCalendarComponent.m
	(-sendEMailUsingTemplateNamed:forObject:previousObject:toAttendees:):
	added a few headers to the ical attachment that could help

	hide the "eventDialog" when the menu pops up.

	* UI/WebServerResources/UIxColorPicker.js (onChooseColor): the
	colour window is now closed once the user has made his choice.

2010-02-15  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* UI/WebServerResources/generic.js (getTarget): ensure the
	returned target has been initialized with prototype extensions.

	* UI/WebServerResources/SchedulerUI.js (gotoToday): set the
	selected day to the today date.

	* UI/WebServerResources/SchedulerUIDnD.js
	(SOGoEventDragGhostController.showGhosts): ghosts now also have an
	"eventInside" DIV to contain the title and draw the border. This
	avoids the overflow of extra pixels added to the DIV heights for
	start and end ghosts.
	(SOGoEventDragController.attachToDayNode): we determine whether
	the event cell are for an invitation, in which case the dragging
	event will be aborted even though the user is technically the
	"owner" of the represented event.

2010-02-13  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* UI/WebServerResources/SchedulerUI.js (attachDragControllers): we
	only attach handlers to subnodes of #calendarHeader DIV.days, not
	..DIV.dayLabels.
	(adjustCalendarHeaderDIV): adapted for IE.

2010-02-12  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* UI/Scheduler/UIxCalMonthView.m (-currentDayId): new method.
	(-currentDayNumber): new method.

	* UI/Scheduler/UIxCalDayTable.m (-currentHourId): new method.
	(-currentAllDayId): new method.
	(-currentDayId): new method.
	(-currentHourLineId): removed method because hourlines are no
	longer present in the template.
	(-currentDayNumber): new accessor, used in javascript to recover
	selection faster when the currently selected date is no longer
	available.

	* UI/WebServerResources/SchedulerUIDnD.js (ScrollController.init):
	enhanced scrolling by setting a limit of 6 steps rather than 2.

	* UI/WebServerResources/SchedulerUI.js (newEventDIV): the right
	limit of event cells is setup using the "right" attribute rather
	than "width", to avoid issues with cell borders.
	(adjustCalendarHeaderDIV): new method that setups the proper
	¨right" attribute for the "calendarHeader" element on non-IE
	browsers. This reduces the amount of hacks and failed attempts to
	take the day view scrollbar into account.
	(changeWeekCalendarDisplayOfSelectedDay): check the class of DIV
	elements to avoid using fixed references that might change over
	time and cause exceptions.
	(onViewEventCallback): use prototype-expanded objects to avoid
	exceptions on IE.

2010-02-11  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* UI/WebServerResources/SchedulerUIDnD.js: adapted code for
	all-day events and monthly view. Added code to avoid modifying
	events when the pointer is out of the draggable zone.

	* UI/WebServerResources/SchedulerUI.js: adapted code for
	all-day events and monthly view.

	* UI/Scheduler/UIxAppointmentActions.m (-adjustAction): we now
	handle all-day events.

2010-02-10  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* UI/WebServerResources/SOGoRootPage.js (initLogin): discard the
	login cookie with the appName set as cookie path.

	* UI/WebServerResources/SchedulerUI.js (newEvent): removed the
	useless "sender" parameter and added "day", "hour" and "duration"
	parameters to obtain a more generic method.
	(newEventFromWidget): new method the previous "newEvent" incarnation.
	(minutesToHM): new method that converts an amount of minutes into
	a string value suitable for an "hm" query parameter.
	(newEventFromDragging): new method suitable as a drag and drop
	callback for creating events.
	(updateEventFromDragging): new method suitable as a drag and drop
	callback for adjusting events.
	(_setupEventsDragAndDrop): new method that setups drag and drop
	controllers for instances of events per calendar.
	(attachDragControllers): new method that instantiate a drag and
	drop controller for each day column.

	* UI/Scheduler/UIxCalListingActions.m
	(_fillBlocks:withEvent:withNumber:): work around the situation
	where the event start would occur after its end, causing a crash.
	Still emits a warning.

	* UI/Scheduler/UIxCalDayTable.m (-currentHourLineId): new method
	replacing "currentHourLineClass". The hour identifier now being
	the value of the element id, the hourline classes are populated
	from the template itself.

	* UI/WebServerResources/generic.js (generateQueryString): adjusted
	method to take only "string" and "number" typed values into
	account when constructing URL parameters.

	* UI/WebServerResources/SchedulerUIDnD.js: new js module with
	classes implementing drag and drop of events.

	a WODirectAction class for ajax calls for appointments.

2010-02-08  Francis Lachapelle  <flachapelle@inverse.ca>

	* UI/Contacts/UIxContactFoldersView.m (-verticalDragHandleStyle):
	new method (was missing), borrowed from UIxCalMainView.m.
	(-horizontalDragHandleStyle): idem.
	(contactsListContentStyle): idem.

	* UI/WebServerResources/ContactsUI.js (-onAddressBookRemove):
	avoid selecting the personal addressbook prior to obtaining the
	user's answer.

	* UI/MailerUI/UIxMailListView.m (-messageSize): improved
	formatting of message size.

2010-02-03  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* UI/MainUI/SOGoRootPage.m (-_standardDefaultAction): add an
	ending "/" to the active url to avoid a mismatch with the login
	cookie path.

	* SoObjects/Contacts/SOGoContactLDIFEntry.m
	(-initWithName:withLDIFEntry:inContainer:): removed "name" ivar
	which had the same purpose as "nameInContainer". We also invoke
	[self initWithName:inContainer:] rather than [self init].
	Incidentally this fixes a leak.

	* SoObjects/Mailer/SOGoMailBodyPart.m (-imap4URL): we assign our
	"imap4URL" ivar so that it can be access directly in order
	methods.

	* Tests/Integration/test-davacl.py
	(DAVCalendarAclTest._testEventDAVAcl): test
	current-user-privilege-set on tasks too.

	* SoObjects/Appointments/SOGoCalendarComponent.m
	(+webdavAclManager): moved method from SOGoAppointmentObject, so
	that tasks can benefit from it too.

	* SoObjects/Appointments/SOGoAppointmentObject.m
	(+webdavAclManager): view-whole-component and view-date-and-time
	are now independent and children of "all". "read" is declared as
	equivalent to the new "SOGoDAVReadPermission". This hack avoids
	problems with ACL hierarchy.

	* Tests/Integration/test-davacl.py (DAVCalendarAclTest._putTask):
	new method that create tasks in the test collection based on a
	template.
	(DAVCalendarAclTest._currentUserPrivilegeSet): new method that
	request the {DAV:}current-user-privilege-set property on the
	specified DAV resource. Also checks whether the request expectedly
	fails or succeeds.
	(DAVCalendarAclTest._comparePrivilegeSets): new helper method to
	compare to arrays.
	(DAVCalendarAclTest._testCollectionDAVAcl): new test helper method
	for ensure that DAV permissions are conform to the SOGo
	permissions on collections.

	SOGoAuthenticator protocol.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoDAVAuthenticator.h: conforms to
	SOGoAuthenticator protocol.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoProxyAuthenticator.m
	(-imapPasswordInContext:forServer:forceRenew:): added method.

	(convention: null password is NO password) but returns an empty
	string by default.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoUserFolder.m (-ownerInContext:): invoke
	setOwner: to retain user.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoObject.m (-initWithName:inContainer:):
	ownerInContext: already retains "owner".

	memory after "loadAllProducts" is invoked, which consumes a lot of
	RAM.

2010-01-28  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoSystemDefaults.m (-CASServiceURL)
	(-authenticationType): new accessors.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoObject.m (+globallyUniqueObjectId): fixed to
	use the result of "random" rather than the function pointer.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoCache.m (-setValue:forKey:expire)
	(-setValue:forKey:, -valueForKey:, -removeValueForKey:): new
	accessors.
	(-CASTicketFromIdentifier:, -CASSessionWithTicket:)
	(-setCASSession:withTicket:forIdentifier:): new accessors enabling
	the CAS session management.

	by the CAS server when authenticating the SOGo server during a
	proxy request.
	(-_casDefaultAction): new "defaultAction" method executed in CAS mode.

	* UI/Common/UIxPageFrame.m (-canLogoff): return NO in CAS mode.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoWebAuthenticator.m (-checkLogin:password:)
	when authentication type is set to "cas", the password is the
	ticket identifying the CAS session. We therefore check if the
	login and the session login match.
	(-imapPasswordInContext:forServer:forceRenew:): new method that
	returns the "password" to use for IMAP connections. In CAS mode,
	a proxy ticket is fetched with the current CAS session. In
	standard mode, we still use the current user's password. The
	"forceRenew:" parameter enables the fetching of a new proxy ticket
	if the current one has expired.
	(-setupAuthFailResponse:withReason:inContext:): we know invoke
	"defaultAction" on the SOGoRootPage instance to make sure all the
	cookies and CAS tickets are taken into account.
	We now pass the request application name as cookie path.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoCASSession.[hm]: new class module
	implementing the class in charge of CAS authentication and proxy
	transactions.

2010-01-27  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	returns YES if the current list item has an email address.

2010-01-22  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* UI/WebServerResources/MailerUI.js (composeNewMessage): fixed
	potential js error in IE when no mailbox is selected.

	* Tools/SOGoToolRestore.m (+initialize): we need to invoke
	[iCalEntityObject+SOGo initializeSOGoExtensions], otherwise the
	extraction of quick records will cause a crash because some global
	variables won't be initialized.

	* UI/Scheduler/UIxCalListingActions.m
	(_fetchFields:ofComponentType:): added field ownerIsOrganizer which
	identifies whether or not the calendar owner is the organizer of
	the event. Also added the field erasable which identifies if the
	active user can delete objects in the current calendar.
	* UI/WebServerResources/SchedulerUI.js
	(-_deleteCalendarEventBlocks): when the organizer deletes an
	event, also delete the event in the calendars of the attendees, if
	visible. Also, don't allow to delete an event if the user can't
	erase objects in the calendar.
	(-_deleteCalendarEventCache:): new function to update the events cache.

2010-01-20  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	subscribe users.

	* UI/PreferencesUI/UIxPreferences.m (-itemTimeFormatTexts): the

	(-adjustProxySubscriptionToUser:remove:forWriteAccess:) removed
	methods.

	* Tests/utilities.py: new module implementing utility classes and
	methods that are used in different test cases.

	* Main/sogod.m (main): set the "GNUSTEP_STRING_ENCODING"
	environment variable to NSUTF8StringEncoding to properly decode
	the user defaults strings in UTF8.

2010-01-15  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoUserSettings.m
	(-setCalendarProxyUsers:withWriteAccess:)
	(calendarProxyUsersWithWriteAccess:)

	module.

	* SoObjects/Appointments/SOGoAppointmentInboxFolder.[hm]: new
	class module that implements the basic "schedule-inbox"
	collection mechanisms, enough to let iCal work properly. To be
	completed for full invitation handling.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoObject.m (-lookupObjectAtDAVUrl:): new method
	that enables DAV reports to lookup objects based on the urls
	passed in their parameters.
	(-davURLAsString): simplified method by making it recurse from its
	top parent.
	(-setRoles:forUsers:): treat a list of users at once.
	(-davPrincipalMatch): removed method since it really pertains to
	/SOGo/dav, which the correct principal-collection-set.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoParentFolder.m (-initSubcribedSubFolders):
	enable the super user to see any user's subscriptions. This
	enables a new set of tests to work properly in super user mode.

	must initialize cssEscapingCount before using it. Also, fixed a
	typo preventing the character buffer from being initialized
	completely.

2010-01-07  Francis Lachapelle  <flachapelle@inverse.ca>

	* SoObjects/SOGo/NSString+Utilities.m (-asCSSIdentifier): replaced
	%lc by %C.
	(-fromCSSIdentifier): idem.

2010-01-07  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* UI/WebServerResources/SchedulerUI.js (onViewEventCallback):
	simplified lookup of "P" elements by groupings them in an array.
	This also fixes a bug where all the returned information would not

	not used before.

	* UI/Scheduler/UIxAppointmentEditor.m (-newAction): new events
	have an ".ics" extension instead of ".vcf".

	* UI/Scheduler/UIxCalMainView.m (-_setupContext): only invoked once

	system timezone, which may differ from it.

	* SoObjects/Appointments/iCalEntityObject+SOGo.m
	(-quickRecordDateAsNumber:withOffset:forAllDay:): we only need to
	compute the delta between the user's timezone and UTC rather than
	the system timezone.

	* SoObjects/Mailer/SOGoMailNamespace.m
	(-lookupName:inContext:acquire:): overriden method because the
	namespace "folders" cannot be created and cannot contain messages.

	* SoObjects/Mailer/SOGoMailAccount.m
	(-otherUsersFolderNamespaces): new method that returns all the
	namespace "folders" in the "other user" namespace. Replaces the
	old "otherUsersFolderName" method.
	(-sharedFolderNamespaces): same as above for the "shared"
	namespace.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoDomainDefaults.m (-otherUsersFolderName)
	(-sharedFolderName): removed obsolete methods.

2010-01-05  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* UI/WebServerResources/MailerUI.js (Mailbox): "this.name" is now
	an escaped form of the mailbox name, that can thus be used to
	generate folder URLs.
	(Mailbox.findMailboxByName): escape the name passed as parameter
	prior to doing a search.

	* UI/WebServerResources/JavascriptAPIExtensions.js
	(asCSSIdentifier): use two arrays rather than an "Object" in order
	to improve performance.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/NSString+Utilities.m (-fromCSSIdentifier): new
	method that converts an escaped string back to a normal one.
	(-asCSSIdentifier): no longer use "replaceString:withString:" in
	order to avoid parsing the string multiple times. This probably
	enhance performances a bit and also avoid double-encoding
	problems.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/NSArray+Utilities.m (-resultsOfSelector): new
	method that applies a selector on the contained objects and
	collect the result objects in a new array.

	* SoObjects/Mailer/SOGoMailFolder.m
	(-lookupName:inContext:acquire:): we must check and create the
	current folder even if the looked up key is a subfolder or a web
	method.

	* SOPE/sope-patchset-r1664.diff: new patchset replacing
	-r1660.diff.
	Added code to handle IMAP namespaces.

2010-01-04  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* SoObjects/Mailer/SOGoMailForward.m (-): we use
	-[SOGoUserDefaults mailComposeMessageType] instead of querying the
	defaults key, so that the fallbacking mechanism between the
	different preference layers can be used.

2009-12-26  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoMailer.m (_smtpSendData:
	toRecipients:sender:): We now honor the 'port'
	part in the SMTP server address. So one can now
	specify hostname:port (like localhost:587) as
	a value of SOGoSMTPServer. This fixes
	http://www.sogo.nu/bugs/view.php?id=201

	* SoObjects/Mailer/SOGoMailForward.m (init):
	Now consider SOGoMailComposeMessageType instead
	of ComposeMessagesType when checking if we are
	using HTML mails composition mode. This fixes
	http://www.sogo.nu/bugs/view.php?id=280

2009-12-25  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* Tools/SOGoToolBackup.m (-fetchUserIDs:):
	We now use a local autorelease pool and flush
	it after every 100 requests to the LDAP (or
	other source type) server.

2009-12-23  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* UI/Scheduler/UIxCalView.m
	Don't call -configureFormatters in -init as it'll
	invoke labelForKey prior to setPage: - resulting
	in the wrong resources manager being selected.
	This fixes: http://www.sogo.nu/bugs/view.php?id=286

	* UI/Templates/ContactsUI/UIxContactFoldersView.wox
	UI/Templates/SchedulerUI/UIxCalMainView.wox
	Modified the uploadForm in those two templates (to add
	const:href="") in order to avoid SOPE sessions being
	created upon access to the calendar or address book module.
	This fixes: http://www.sogo.nu/bugs/view.php?id=208

	* SoObjects/SOGo/NSDictionary+Utilities.m (-userRecordAsLDIFEntry)
	We skip the "isGroup" attribute from the list of attributes
	to include during LDIF generation. This fixes:
	http://www.sogo.nu/bugs/view.php?id=221

	* UI/WebServerResources/SchedulerUI.js - we also invoke
	refreshTasks() in onCalendarReload(). This fixes:
	http://www.sogo.nu/bugs/view.php?id=250

2009-12-22  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* Removed all the Kolab-related stuff (more specifically,
	associated mail part viewers)

	* Removed all references to "anais" stuff.

	* SoObjects/Mailer/SOGoMailFolder.m (-deleteUIDs:inContext:):
	we check if we  aren't in the Trash folder already before try to
	copy over deleted messages.

	in all calendar views.

2009-12-22  Francis Lachapelle  <flachapelle@inverse.ca>

	* UI/Scheduler/UIxAppointmentEditor.m (-viewAction): added
	calendar name in returned dictionary.

2009-12-22  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* Tests/test-webdav.py (WebDAVTest.testPrincipalCollectionSet2):
	fixed test to use the proper collection URL as expected value,
	rather that the freebusy.ifb resource URL.

	* SoObjects/Appointments/SOGoAppointmentFolder.m
	(_appendComponentProperties:matchingFilters:toResponse:)
	(_appendComponentProperties:matchingURLs:toResponse:): ensure that
	baseURL ends with "/".

2009-12-21  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoUserFolder.m (-fetchContentObjectNames):
	fixed a potential crash by removing the "static" attribute of the
	"cos" local variable.

2009-12-19  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* SoObjects/Appointments/SOGoUserFolder+Appointments.m
	(_davPersonalCalendarURL): We make sure we handle the
	presence or not of the trailing slash when we call
	-davURLAsString on the parent object. See
	http://www.sogo.nu/bugs/view.php?id=74 for
	all details.

2009-12-14  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* UI/MailPartViewers/UIxMailPartHTMLViewer.m
	Dropped the use of NGMimeType and we now use
	the same string decoding method as used
	for text/plain parts.

2009-12-14  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* Tools/SOGoToolRemoveDoubles.m (-processFolder:ofUser:withFoM:):
	same as below.

	* Tools/SOGoToolCheckDoubles.m (-processIndexResults:withFoM:):
	same as below.

	* SoObjects/Mailer/NSString+Mail.m
	(-stringByConvertingCRLNToHTML): invokde [NSString UTF8String]
	rather than cStringUsingEncoding: NSUTF8StringEncoding, since the
	latter provokes a crash that the former doesn't.

	* UI/Common/UIxPageFrame.m (_stringsForFramework:): use the system
	default when the active user does not resolve.

2009-12-11  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* Added a patch from Albrecht Gebhardt <albrecht.gebhardt@algepop.net>
	that offers a "Reload" button in the Web contacts management
	module.

2009-12-11  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* UI/PreferencesUI/UIxPreferences.m (-setUserShortDateFormat:):
	fixed handling of the value "default", which actually should
	unset the value in the user defaults.

2009-12-09  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoUserFolder.m (-toManyRelationShipKeys)
	(-lookupName:inContext:acquire:): fixed typo preventing access to
	Contacts module.

2009-12-08  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* SoObjects/SOGo/WORequest+SOGo.m (-handledByDefaultHandler):
	return "not isSoWebDAVRequest".

	* Main/SOGo.m (-lookupName:inContext:acquire:): ensure the web
	access is enabled or the request is a DAV request before
	proceeding.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoUserFolder.m (-toManyRelationShipKeys)
	(-fetchContentObjectNames): ensure the proper dav access is
	enabled in order before listing the related objects.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoSystemDefaults.m (-isWebAccessEnabled)
	(-isCalendarDAVAccessEnabled, isAddressBookDAVAccessEnabled): new
	self-explanatory accessors.

	* Main/SOGo.m (-davURLAsString): we ensure that the url ends with
	"/" since the /SOGo object is a collection and the caller may rely
	on this.

2009-12-07  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* UI/PreferencesUI/UIxPreferences.m (-defaultAction):
	setVacationOptions: and setForwardOptions: are now set from here.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoDomainDefaults.m (-forwardEnabled)
	(-vacationEnabled): we must query "SOGoForwardEnabled" and
	"SOGoVacationEnabled", respectively.

2009-12-03  Francis Lachapelle  <flachapelle@inverse.ca>

	* SoObjects/SOGo/iCalEntityObject+Utilities.m (-findParticipant:):
	we now search in all attendees, including attendees with role
	NON-PARTICIPANT.

2009-12-02  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoUserDefaults.m (+initialize): we need to
	initialize the profile class from the constructor as this method
	may be invoked before all modules are loaded.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoSource.h: added new "SOGoDNSource" protocol
	as a child protocol of "SOGoSource".

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoUserManager.m: added new
	"SOGoUserManagerRegistry" class that handles the mapping between
	source types and their corresponding classes.
	(-[SOGoUserManager registryClass]): new method that returns the
	class name of the registry class, which can be overriden to handle
	other types.

2009-12-01  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* Reworked the calendar's categories (introduced
	the "Meeting" category).

2009-12-01  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* UI/Scheduler/UIxComponentEditor.m (-categoryList): the returned
	list is now sorted, except if the category of the event was not
	always present in the list (kept on top).

	* UI/PreferencesUI/UIxPreferences.m (-categoryList): simplified
	method by returning only the array of defined categories from the
	user defaults or those defined in the Localizable.strings and sort
	the resulting array.
	(-categoryColor): new accessor that return the color associated
	with the value in the "category" ivar, if not exists, we return
	the default from SOGoCalendarDefaultCategoryColor.
	(-setCategoriesValue): simplified method since we now receive a
	dictionary. The dictionary is now transferred as a JSON object
	rather than a property list.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoUserDefaults.m
	(-setCalendarCategoriesColors:, -calendarCategoriesColors):
	SOGoCalendarCategoriesColors is now a dictionary. The values are
	migrated in _migrateCalendarCategories.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoDomainDefaults.m
	(-calendarDefaultCategoryColor): new accessor for the domain
	default SOGoCalendarDefaultCategoryColor.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoDefaultsSource.m (-boolForKey:)
	(-floatForKey:, -integerForKey:, -dataForKey:, -stringForKey:)
	(-dictionaryForKey:, -arrayForKey:, -stringArrayForKey:): added
	type checking and warnings.

2009-11-30  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoDefaultsSource.m (-setBool:forKey:): we
	encode boolean values as integers to avoid confusing the boolean
	objective-c parsers when reading values coming back from the JS
	code.

	* UI/WebServerResources/SchedulerUI.js (initCalendars): the
	"ShowCompletedTasks" parameter is in the UserSettings dictionary.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoDefaultsSource.m
	(-migrateOldDefaultsWithDictionary:): when migrating between two
	existing keys, the new value is automatically overwritten with the
	old one, since it causes a problem with the values inherited from
	SOGoDefaults.plist.

2009-11-29  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoUserManager.m
	(-authenticationSourceIDsInDomain:): now takes a domain argument.
	Contrarily to contact sources, specifying a domain will cause the
	generic sources to be ignored.
	(-fetchUsersMatching:inDomain:): now takes a domain argument.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/LDAPSource.m (-initFromUDSource:inDomain):
	removed handing of "domain attribute", since the underlying
	mechanism causes complex code for an unrealistic case.

2009-11-28  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoUserSettings.m: new class module designed to
	be the counterpart to SOGoUserDefaults.m.

	* UI/PreferencesUI/UIxPreferences.m (-): "hours" is now a static
	variable, rather than an ivar.

	* UI/MainUI/SOGoRootPage.m (+initialize): the supportedLanguages
	are not available from the SOGoSystemDefaults
	(SOGoDefaults.plist).

	* UI/MailerUI/UIxMailView.m (+initialize): we never used
	"SOGoDontUseETagsForMailViewer".

	* UI/MailerUI/UIxMailEditor.m (+initialize): we never used
	"SOGoShowInternetMarker" and "SOGoInternetMailHeaders".

	* SoObjects/Mailer/SOGoDraftObject.m (+initialize):
	"TextPlainType" was never used.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoSystemDefaults.m: new class module handling
	the getting of system (or "application") defaults, as well as
	default values for users and domains.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoDomainDefaults.m: new class module handling
	the getting of domain defaults, as well as default values for for
	users belonging to the corresponding domain.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoUserDefaults.m: new class module handling
	the setting and getting of user defaults.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoLDAPDefaults.h: new protocol module for the
	handling of "recursive" ldap defaults.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoDefaultsSource.m: new module class acting as
	a proxy between NSDictionary, NSUserDefaults and SOGoUserProfile,
	enabling the possibility of hierarchy and fallbacks.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoUserProfile.m: new name for SOGoUserDefaults.
	(-arrayForKey:, -stringForKey:, -dataForKey:, -boolForKey:)
	(-floatForKey:): removed obsolete methods (as well as their setter
	counterparts).

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoSQLUserProfile.m: new class module for
	handling the SQL backend of the SOGoUserProfile.

	* UI/SOGoUI/WOContext+UIx.m: removed obsolete class.

2009-11-27  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoUserDefaults.m (-fetchJSONProfileFromDB): the
	isNew flag depends on the presence of the row in the database
	rather than on the existence of the value.

2009-11-26  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoUserDefaults.m (-synchronize): avoid fetching
	the values from the database/the cache when they are successfully
	stored.
	(-fetchJSONProfileFromDB): sql-quoted quote characters do not
	apply here. Therefore we no longer need to unescape them.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoCache.m (_cacheValues:ofType:forLogin:): we
	also fill the local cache with the new value to avoid ignoring it
	next time the cache is invoked.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/NSDictionary+BSJSONAdditions.m
	(+dictionaryWithJSONString:): method moved from NSDictionary into
	NSMutableDictionary for consistency.

2009-11-26  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* SoObjects/Mailer/SOGoMailObject+Draft.m
	(_fetchFileAttachmentKey:intoArray:withPath:): we
	try to also use basic types (application/, audio/, ...)
	when forwarding a mail with attachments and no
	Content-Disposition header (or filename) was found. This
	avoid losing attachments when forwarding mails.
	* UI/PreferencesUI/UIxPreferences.m
	We retain/release properly the vacationOptions and
	forwardOptions ivars.

2009-11-24  Francis Lachapelle  <flachapelle@inverse.ca>

	* SoObjects/Mailer/NSData+Mail.m (-decodedHeader): renamed from
	decodedSubject. The decoding algorithm is now recursive.

	* SoObjects/Mailer/NSString+Mail.m (-decodedHeader): renamed from
	decodedSubject. The string is now decoded by parts.

2009-11-24  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoGroup.m
	Initialize the local var entry to nil to avoid
	a crash if only one SQL source was specified

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SQLSource.m
	Properly invoke cancelFetch on cusors that can return
	more than one value (prior to releasing the channel)

2009-11-23  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* Tools/sogo-tool.m (main): we check "SOGoUserSources" rather than
	the obsolete "SOGoLDAPSources".

2009-11-20  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoDAVAuthenticator.m (-init): removed method,
	removed the "SOGoAuthenticationMethod" user default, which was
	never used.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoWebAuthenticator.m (-init): removed method,
	removed the "SOGoAuthenticationMethod" user default, which was
	never used.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoProxyAuthenticator.m (-init): removed method,
	removed the "SOGoAuthenticationMethod" user default, which was
	never used.

	* Main/sogod.m (prepareUserDefaults): replaces
	"convertOldSOGoDomain", automatically set WOMessageUseUTF8,
	WOParsersUseUTF8 and NGUseUTF8AsURLEncoding to YES in the user
	defaults.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoUserDefaults.m (_sqlJsonRepresentation:): the
	escaping of "\\" was done in the wrong direction.
	(-storeJSONProfileInDB:): we commit the transaction to avoid a
	lock on the profile table.

2009-11-19  Francis Lachapelle  <flachapelle@inverse.ca>

	* SoObjects/Mailer/SOGoMailReply.m (-messageBody): don't try to
	remove the bottom signature when replying to an email, in order to
	avoid situations where a previous message follows the last signature.

2009-11-19  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoUserDefaults.m (-fetchJSONProfileFromDB):
	extracted the conversion of property list values to JSON values
	into a new separate method (-_convertPListToJSON:), that will be
	invoked by -jsonRepresentation.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SQLSource.m (-checkLogin:andPassword:):
	(_lookupContactEntry:considerEmail:, -allEntryIDS)
	(_lookupContactEntry:consideringEmail:, fetchContactsMatching:):
	check whether the channel is valid before using it or report an
	error otherwise. Also, we release the channel after our
	operations, to avoid creating hundreds of biglions of useless
	and stalled connections.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoUser.m (-userDefaults, -userSettings): the
	cache handling has now been put in the SOGoUserDefaults class.
	(-primaryUserDefaults, -primaryUserSettings): removed useless
	methods.
	(-userDefaultsClassName): added accessor to allow different
	classes.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoUserDefaults.m (-primaryFetchProfile): split
	method to separate the cache data and the db data. We know invoke
	the "jsonRepresentation" method, which is the real data accessor
	now.
	(-primaryStoreProfile): user profile data is now serialized as a
	JSON string in order to avoid constant conversions between the
	plist and the json formats, from and to the cache.
	(-jsonRepresentation): we now handle the cache data from here, as
	it made more sense and reduces the code size in SOGoUser.m.
	(-fetchProfile): now a void method.
	(-storeJSONProfileInDB:): new method that handles the DB portion
	of primaryStoreProfile, providing a corollary to
	fetchJSONProfileFromDB.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoCache.m (+initialize): the memcached host can
	now be configured using the "SOGoMemCachedHost" user default. The
	method now contains initialization code for global vars that used
	to be in -init instead.
	(-userSettingsForLogin:,-userDefaultsForLogin:,-userAttributesForLogin:):
	refactoring: those accessors now only return an NSString
	associated with their respective key. There is no longer any
	dictionary de-/serialization occuring in SOGoCache.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoParentFolder.m (-subFolders): we raise the
	exceptions we get only if the current request is a PROPFIND. This
	avoids a useless restart of SOGo when the database is down during
	the execution of other requests.

	* Tools/sogo-tool.m (main): we now check that the SOGo
	configuration is valid and consequently that the tool runs under
	the same account as SOGo.

	* UI/Scheduler/UIxComponentEditor.m (-_handleAttendeeData): make
	direct use of the JSON constructor of NSDictionary rather than
	instantiating an NSScanner. This simplifies the code.

2009-11-18  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* SoObjects/SOGo/NSString+Utilities.m (-isJSONString): new utility
	method that determines whether the current string is a json
	document.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/NSDictionary+BSJSONAdditions.m
	(+dictionaryWithJSONString:): this constructor now explicitly
	returns an NSMutableDictionary to avoid messing with mutable
	copies and useless allocation/deallocation in the callers.

	* Main/SOGo.m (+initialize): removed the "debugObjectAllocation" global
	variable since "debugLeaks" has the same meaning. Instantiate a
	"SOGoStartupLogger" object in order to avoid using NSLog when the
	parent process is starting, in order to work-around the caching of
	the pid in NSLog.

2009-11-16  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoCache.m: "cache", "users" and "localCache"
	are now regular ivars. "sharedCache" is now located within the
	"sharedCache" constructor. "killCache" is now an instance method.

2009-11-10  Francis Lachapelle  <flachapelle@inverse.ca>

	* UI/Scheduler/UIxComponentEditor.m (-_handleAttendeesEdition):
	avoid scanning JSON when there's no attendee.

2009-11-10  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* UI/SOGoUI/UIxComponent.m (-applicationPath): new method that
	really returns the name of the WO application.
	(-modulePath): renamed the old applicationPath method to be more
	accurate about its purpose.

2009-11-07  Ludovic Marcotte <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoCache.m - if we get a JSON
	error when trying to convert our string coming
	from memcached, we don't store it to the cache
	and we log the error.
	* Modified the code so we always use lower-case
	headers prior to sending mails. This is to avoid
	an uber-lameness in SOPE. Also added warnings
	around that code so we can get rid of SOPE-mime,
	we'll do things cleanly.

2009-11-06  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* UI/WebServerResources/UIxPreferences.js (_setupEvents): we check
	whether "categoriesValue" resolves properly before assigning it
	a new value.

2009-11-05  Francis Lachapelle  <flachapelle@inverse.ca>

	* Scripts/updates.php: Minor changes to support when PHP short_open_tag
	parameter is set to Off.

	* UI/WebServerResources/ContactsUI.js (getMenus): activated the
	list creation option of the addresbooks contextual menu.

	* UI/WebServerResources/SOGoRootPage.js (onFieldKeyDown): don't
	submit the form if no password is typed.

2009-11-04  Francis Lachapelle  <flachapelle@inverse.ca>

	* Major refresh of CSS stylesheets.
	* UI/WebServerResources/SOGoAutoCompletion.js
	(performSearchCallback): fixed position of popup menu when used in
	the contacts list editor.

2009-11-04  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* SoObjects/SOGo/NSDictionary+Utilities.m
	(+dictionaryFromStringsFile:): instantiate autoreleased objects.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/NSArray+Utilities.m (-jsonRepresentation):
	instantiate autoreleased objects.

2009-10-30  Francis Lachapelle  <flachapelle@inverse.ca>

	* UI/WebServerResources/SchedulerUI.js: the events list is now
	refreshed in the AJAX callback. This avoid seeing an empty table
	while refreshing the events list.

	* UI/WebServerResources/UIxPreferences.js
	(addDefaultEmailAddresses): fixed issue in vacation tab when
	adding the defaults values to a empty list.

	* UI/WebServerResources/UIxComponentEditor.js
	(onComponentEditorClose): new method that closes definition popup
	windows associated to the event (attendees/recurrence/reminder).

2009-10-28  Francis Lachapelle  <flachapelle@inverse.ca>

	* UI/Contacts/UIxContactView.m (-primaryEmail, -secondaryEmail):
	remove double-quotes from FN attribute to avoid JavaScript errors.

	* UI/WebServerResources/UIxMailToSelection.js: removed duplicated
	functionality in addressFieldLostFocus. Removed the ability to set
	an auto-completion text field to read-only.

	* UI/WebServerResources/UIxListEditor.js: refactoring.

	* UI/WebServerResources/ContactsUI.js: Improved text of import
	cards dialog.

	* UI/WebServerResources/SchedulerUI.js: Improved text of import
	events dialog.

	* UI/Contacts/UIxListEditor.m (-setReferencesValue:): rewrote
	method since only the contacts IDs are received from the web
	interface. The names and emails are retrieve from the addressbook.

	* SoObjects/Contacts/SOGoContactGCSFolder.m
	(-lookupContactWithName): new method that returns a dictionary
	with the attributes of a contact.

	* SoObjects/Appointments/SOGoAppointmentObject.m
	(-changeParticipationStatus:withDelegate:forRecurrenceId:): added
	exception when delegated user is the organizer.

2009-10-28  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

        * UI/MailPartViewers/UIxMailPartICalActions.m
	(_setupChosenEventAndEventObject:) - we now
	correctly save the event contained in the mail
	when clicking on Accept/Decline/Delegate into
	the user's calendar if it's not in there already.

2009-10-27  Cyril Robert <crobert@inverse.ca>

	* UI/Common/UIxPageFrame.m (userEmail): Added to display the user's email
	address in the linkBanner.
	* UI/Contacts/UIxListView.m
	(itemHref, itemName, itemEmail): Added to allow clickable email addresses in
	UIxListView.
	(itemText): Removed, no longer needed.

2009-10-27  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

        * SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoGCSFolder.m (create)
	We send the advisory to the owner of the newly
	created collection, not the currently logged on
	user (which might be different). The sender will
	nevertheless be the currently logged on user, as
	it's this particular user that triggered the
	creation of the collection.
	* Documentation/SOGo Installation Guide.odt
	Updated to set WOUseRelativeURLs to YES instead
	of NO by default.
	* We now correctly lowercase the SOGoLDAPContactInfoAttribute
	attribute everywhere.

2009-10-26  Francis Lachapelle  <flachapelle@inverse.ca>

	* UI/WebServerResources/ContactsUI.js
	(onContactDeleteEventCallback): fixed retrieval of card name when
	deletion is not possible (caused by a possible bug in prototype.js).
	(setEventsOnAddressBook): don't observe the double-click event on
	addressbooks not owned by the user.

2009-10-25  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

        * Fixed many compilation warnings
	* Updated the Mobile Device Configuration Guide
	in order to document the iPhone OS 3.x configuration
	settings (iPhone / iPod)
	* UI/Scheduler/UIxComponentEditor.m (_handleCustomRRule:)
	Improved the robustness of the code.

2009-10-24  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

        * Updated the Czech translation - patch from
	Milos Wimmer <wimmer@zcu.cz>
	* Added a French translation of the new Vacation
	and Forward preference tabs.
	* Updated the French translation in the
	Administration module.
	* Updated the French translation of the Calendar
	properties window.
	* Updated the French translation with regard to
	event delegation support.
	* UI/Scheduler/UIxCalListingActions.m
	We now handle BOOL as real BOOL when storing them
	in the prefs instead of going with NSNumber. No
	need to do that and our JSON generator/parser
	will handle this properly. This avoid a dump
	crash when toying with the "Show completed tasks"
	toggle in the calendar module.

2009-10-23  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* SoObjects/Contacts/SOGoContactSourceFolder.m
	(-initWithName:andDisplayName:inContainer:): use the source name
	when the displayname is nil.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoUserManager.m (_registerSource:): added
	sanity checks and warnings to the user.

2009-10-23  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

        * SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoUserFolder.m (-subFoldersFromFolder:)
	Addded a check to NOT return web calendars in this query.

2009-10-15  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

        * Added SOPE/NGCards/TimeZones/* - generated from
	the official Olson databases. This is to allow SOGo
	to include VTIMEZONE components on _new_ events or

	is not an attendee when dealing with web calendars.

        Modified -userDefaults to set the timezone when prefs
        have first been set.

	(-initWithName:withLDIFEntry:inContainer:): we no longer retain
	"container" in order to avoid a leak.

	SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoserManager.m
	* Added SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoSource.h and
	SoObjects/SOGo/SQLSource.{h,m}

	change.
	* SoObjects/SOGo/LDAPSource.m
	We trim the bind field value prior to adding it to our
	LDAP search filter.

2009-09-23  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* UI/WebServerResources/SOGoAutoCompletion.js
	(SOGoAutoCompletionInterface.onKeyDown): (needs review) we don't
	overwrite the input's name attributes with the "uname". Otherwise
	the form will not have the correct data when submitted and the
	to/cc/bcc fields will be ignored.

	* SoObjects/Mailer/SOGoMailObject.m (-fetchPlainTextParts:):
	handle the fact that the "fetch" key in a RawResponse (NGHashMap)
	may not be the only response. Since [NGHashMap objectForKey:]

	* SoObjects/SOGo/NSArray+Utilities.m (-flattenedDictionaries): new
	method that merges the keys and values of all contained
	dictionaries into one single dictionary.

	propagate in the cache, since we no longer use gdnc for it.

	the alarm refresh if the "calendarBannerLink" link is not
	available (when calendar is disabled).

	* UI/WebServerResources/UIxPreferences.js (initPreferences)
	(savePreferences): don't bother with the categoriesList if it's
	not accessible (when calendar is disabled).

2009-09-17  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* Tests/test-config.py: new functional test to validate the test
	configuration file.

	* UI/PreferencesUI/UIxPreferences.m (-userComposeMessagesType):
	return a default value of @"text" if the default compose type has
	never been changed by the user. Otherwise, saving the preferences
	will never enable the window to be closed since the new value will
	always be different from nil.

2009-09-17  Cyril Robert <crobert@inverse.ca>

	* UI/Contacts/UIxListEditor.m: Renamed "name" to "listName"

2009-09-16  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* Updated the ICS import text to be more specific
	* We now warn for no SSL bundle in GNUstep when
	trying to load a remote ICS file and it's failing
	over SSL. It's a guess but it's better than nothing.

2009-09-16  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoGCSFolder.m (-lookupName:inContext:acquire:):
	instanciated objects may be queried twice during the same session,

	void using "delete" on the stored array because IE 7 is too dumb.

	* UI/MailPartViewers/UIxMailPartHTMLViewer.m
	(-startElement:namespace:rawName:attributes:): treat tag names as
	lowercase (xhtml compliance). Replace all "src" tagnames with
	"unsafe-src" for distant images. No longer take an "unsafe" url
	parameter into account.

	class that implements the viewer for multipart/signed messages.

	the case where then authenticator doesn't handle authentication
	cookies. In such cases, this method should theorically never be
	invoked though.

	* UI/Common/UIxPageFrame.m (-canLogoff): new bool accessor that
	returns whether the current authenticator handles user
	disconnection or not, in which case we hide the "logoff" link in
	the UIxPageFrame.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoCache.m (-registerUser:withName:): adjusted
	method to take an additional "userName" parameter in order to
	store users with the username used at login time rather than their

	accordingly.

	preference would never be set, causing a crash when the moduleURL

	PROPFIND is made on the current collection. If a DB error occurs,
	we raise it to prevent SOPE from returning a 207 status code.

	* UI/Scheduler/UIxAppointmentEditor.m ([UIxAppointmentEditor
	-dealloc]): we release componentCalendar here to avoid a leak
	(since if set, it was through a call to ASSIGN()).

2008-09-05  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	-filename]): new method that returns the filename to the current
	part by taking the different mime implementations into account.

	acceptAnyUser to YES only when the SOGoAuthentificationMethod user
	default is set to "bypass".

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoAuthenticator.m ([SOGoAuthenticator

	-folderIsMandatory]): returns YES if nameInContainer is set to
	"personal", which is the default address book.

	* SoObjects/Appointments/SOGoAppointmentFolder.m
	([SOGoAppointmentFolder -folderIsMandatory]): returns YES since
	users must have one Calendar folder (one and only one).
	([SOGoAppointmentFolder -_privacySqlString]): unescape the

	attendees will remain in their owner's Calendar.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/SOGoObject.m ([SOGoObject

	the user has the "ObjectReader" role on the parent container, then
	he is granted the "ObjectViewer" role on this object. Same for
	"ObjectEraser", although this might change later.

	* UI/Scheduler/UIxComponentEditor.m ([UIxComponentEditor

	directly from here. That way we can determine whether the object

	during object creation.

	* SoObjects/Contacts/SOGoContactLDAPFolder.m

	-ownerInContext:localContext]): overriden method because we are an
	IMAP4 client and we need a bit more intelligence to deduce the

	There is no need to subscract the start from the length if a space

	usermanager now.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/AgenorUserDefaults.m ([AgenorUserDefaults

	-appendSystemSources]): pass LDAPSource objects to
	SOGoContactLDAPFolder instances.

	* SoObjects/Mailer/SOGoDraftObject.m: extract the raw email

	([SOGoCalendarComponent -getUIDsForICalPersons:iCalPersons]):
	idem.

	* SoObjects/Contacts/SOGoContactLDIFEntry.[hm]: new class module
	replacing the SOGoContactLDAPEntry module. It was renamed as such

	It thus can now handle data from any source of LDIF data, not
	only coming from LDAP.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/LDAPUserManager.[hm]: new class module
	implementing most of what used to be the AgenorUserManager class.
	The difference is that users are cached in the forme of
	dictionaries and many sources are used. Also, it can be used to
	search LDAP contacts.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/LDAPSource.[hm]: new class module implementing
	the concept of "ldap source", to be used by all the classes
	needing access to LDAP-provided information: addressbooks and the

	used so that both the regular email address and the "system email
	address" of the user are matched against the participants emails.

	forwared to [AgenorUserManager getSystemEmailForUID:].

	* UI/Scheduler/UIxComponentEditor.m ([UIxComponentEditor

	task and appointment editor classes. This method makes also use of
	the new method "isOrganizerOrOwner:" and "participant:" in
	SOGoCalendarComponent.

	* UI/Scheduler/UIxAppointmentEditor.m ([UIxAppointmentEditor
	-toolbar]): removed method, replaced with a method with the same
	name in UIxComponentEditor.

	UIxComponentEditor.

	* SoObjects/SOGo/AgenorUserDefaults.m ([AgenorUserDefaults

	initWithName:inContainer:. Instead, directly initialize the ivars
	as it is supposed to be to avoid an infinite loop whenever one of
	those two methods are overriden.

	removed method.

	mandatorily be overriden to update the user rights from the
	elements of the subclassed form.

	* UI/Common/UIxAclEditor.m ([UIxAclEditor -_prepareUsers]): we
	check if the uid is already listed before adding it to our array.

	-setRoles:rolesforUser:uidforObjectAtPath:objectPathArray]): the
	"roles" parameter is now an NSArray instead of a string. Therefore

	the mailbox entry's parent hierarchy to ensure it is made visible
	when the page is being displayed. (new function: expandUpperTree).
	- mailbox loading: when loading a mailbox where a message was
	previously selected, we invoke its url with the "pageforuid"
	parameter correctly specified. During callback processing, we scan

	Used to generate the javascript code for the folder dtree.

	* UI/Templates/MailerUI/UIxMailPanelFrame.wox: the components
	using that container-template are now using UIxMailMainFrame
	since UIxMailPanelFrame had no real interest. File removed.

	* UI/WebServerResources/dtree.{css,js}: new files to handle
	javascript-generated mailbox tree. Modified from original version
	by integrating the previous code with the one we are using for
	selections and mailbox handling. Minor visual enhancements too...

	* SoObjects/Mailer/SOGoUser+Mail.m: if only one identity is to be

	way. Renamed "getSelection" to "getSelectedNodes" to avoid a
	namespace conflict. Added "onMenuClick(node, event, menuId)" to
	handle popup menus through "onclick" element attributes (node =

	popup).

	-snapshot]): add an entry for "email" into the snapshot
	dictionary if a "contactEmail" URL parameter was detected and if

	* UI/Contacts/Toolbars/SOGoContactFolder.toolbar: the "new card"
	button now invokes the newContact() js function in ContactsUI.js

	stripped from its navigation bar.

	* UI/Contacts/ContactsUI.js: new module specific to the ContactsUI
	bundle (AddressBook).

	for the Contacts and Scheduler products and put in their respectir
	Toolbars/ subdirectories. Finally,
	UI/Templates/{UIxToolbarButton,UIxToolbarSeparator}.wox, and
	UI/Common/{UIxToolbarButton,UIxToolbarSeparator}.m were removed
	and an invocation to the UIxToolbar component was put at the top
	of UI/Templaces/UIxPageFrame.wox.

	within the templates whether a separator should be displayed.
